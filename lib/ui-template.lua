-- THE PUBLIC API IS UNCHANGED FROM v1 AND v2. Nineteen game scripts call it and
-- not one of them was touched for this redesign: UI.Window, win:Page/Refresh/
-- SetStatus/Destroy, page:Card, card:Toggle/Stepper/Slider/Dropdown/Button/
-- Label/Readout, and every UI.theme.* / UI.icon.* / UI.font.* key.
--
-- What changed is the whole look, from the XYUREI X-FLOID mockup:
--
--   * 820x582 instead of 920x580, radius 13. It reads as a tool, not a window.
--   * The 240px sidebar is gone. Navigation is a 46px ICON RAIL - the pages had
--     names AND icons before and the names were dead weight; the page name now
--     lives once, in the header, where you are already looking.
--   * A tinted STATUS STRIP under the header carries the master toggle and three
--     numbers. That is what you glance at while playing, so it sits above the
--     controls rather than inside them.
--   * Cards became BLOCKS: a bordered box with a header band (icon, mono caps
--     label, "3 / 3 an") and hairline-separated rows. The band is what makes a
--     group readable without the card needing a drop shadow.
--   * A DISCORD BAR is pinned above the footer. It is the only outbound link and
--     it is always visible.
--   * Palette is flat violet on near-black - #8b5cf6 on #0d0a14 - and the accent
--     is a single colour, not the v2 violet->cyan ramp. The ramp fought every
--     screenshot and made the good/warn/bad tones harder to read.
--
-- Roblox has no inline SVG, so the mockup's stroked icons stay single glyphs
-- (UI.icon). Sora/IBM Plex Mono do not exist either: GothamBold stands in for
-- headings, Gotham for body, Code for every number and mono label.

-- Where a ScreenGui is PARENTED decides whether the game can find it, and the
-- three containers are not equally safe. Measured in BloxStrike from a thread set
-- to identity 2 (what a normal LocalScript runs as): `game:GetService("CoreGui")`
-- comes back NIL, so a panel in there cannot be walked onto - while
-- `PlayerGui:GetChildren()` answers normally and lists every child by name. The
-- old order was CoreGui first and PlayerGui as the fallback, which is right up
-- until the executor refuses CoreGui: the panel then lands in the one container
-- every client script can read, under a name that says exactly what it is.
--
-- So: gethui() first (not in the DataModel at all), CoreGui second, and if it
-- really has to be PlayerGui the name is randomised - a panel that is visible is
-- one thing, a panel that is visible AND identifies the script is another.
--
-- And a panel that ends up in PlayerGui has been RENAMED, so nothing can find it
-- by name afterwards - not the next run's sweep, not a person reading the tree.
-- Measured 2026-09-06 in +1 Cut Grass Adventure: the window was on screen as
-- `PlayerGui._215795` while a sweep for "CutGrassPanel" reported none, which is
-- exactly how a re-execute ends up with two panels stacked. So hostGui registers
-- every panel under the name the SCRIPT asked for, in the shared global table
-- rather than as an attribute on the instance - an attribute is a fixed string
-- sitting on the object and would hand back the identification the random name
-- exists to avoid.

-- message ("config section missing (save config)" and "cannot pick the
-- difficulty" - the difficulty dropdown was there, it just never stayed).
--
-- One line per script does the whole job:
--
--   UI.config("cleanleaves", CONFIG)     -- right after the UI is loaded
--
-- and the reason it needs no other change anywhere is the ORDER. Controls read
-- their initial value out of CONFIG when they are BUILT, so merging the saved
-- values into CONFIG *before* the panel is built makes every control come up
-- showing the saved state by itself. Nothing has to be told what it is bound to.
--
-- Saving is the other half and is deliberately not a button the user has to
-- remember: a 4s loop serialises the table and writes only when the text
-- changed. Sorted keys make that comparison stable, so an unchanged panel never
-- touches the disk.
--
-- Format is Lua source, not JSON. HttpService:JSONEncode cannot round-trip a
-- table with mixed keys and turns an empty one into `[]`, and the dictionaries
-- already prove that loading a table with loadstring works on every executor.
