-- [💎] Sell Ores ⛏️ - by seltonmt
--
-- Place 122572082932179. Loop: pull the roller lever, buy the rolled ore onto a
-- pedestal, let the drills fill a crate, pick the crate up, sell it, spend the
-- money on upgrades.
--
-- Everything below was measured through the bridge:
--
--   * The game fires no RemoteEvents for player actions. A full manual run was
--     recorded with a __namecall hook AND hookfunction on both FireServer and
--     InvokeServer - all three verified against self-tests - and not one call
--     appeared. Every action is either a ProximityPrompt or a SurfaceGui button
--     out in the world.
--   * Prompts are validated against the server's copy of the character, so the
--     position has to be held for a moment before firing, exactly like the other
--     prompt-driven games.
--   * SurfaceGui buttons on the base boards DO expose their Activated
--     connection, so upgrades are bought by firing those.
--   * BaseCrateStateChanged arrives every ~2.7s with the whole base state
--     (furnace, carried crate, crate count) and is the only reliable oracle.
--   * Base ownership is a plain attribute: Bases.BaseN.OwnerUserId.
--
-- Robux buttons are never touched. On the boards they are the ones priced
-- without a dollar sign (49, 19, 79, 399, 999).

-- Per-ore levels ------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Every tunnel has its own ore level, shown on the BaseBuildTunnelGui panel as

--
--   BaseBuildTunnelAction(baseName, floorNumber, tunnelName, "IncreaseLevel")
--     -> {result = {Price, LevelsAdded, Level}, success}
--
-- and there is an "IncreaseLevel10" for ten at once. Verified live: Jade Ore on
-- Floor 1 Tunnel 1 went from level 2 to 3 and cost exactly the 5,110 the reply
-- reported. This is the mechanic behind the level 12 Stone Ore that was sitting
-- in a tunnel - it was never automated until now.
--
-- Levels raise INCOME PER ORE, not growth speed (growTime did not move), which
-- is precisely what a base whose drones all idle on OreNotReady needs: more
-- money per drill without needing the ore back any sooner.
--
-- OreMetadata gives both curves: income rises about 12% per level while the
-- price rises about 46%, so early levels are excellent and later ones fall off a
-- cliff. Ranking by payback keeps it on the good side of that curve.

-- rather than opening a product prompt, so the id alone is the whole call.
--
-- Only the Growth Gems are bought: they multiply ore regeneration (2x for 5
-- minutes at $500,000 up to 12x for 15 minutes) which feeds the same loop that
-- earns the money back. The Coatings apply a mutation to a single ore and are
-- left alone. Because a gem is a consumable that expires, it is only bought when
-- the balance is a full order of magnitude above its price - otherwise it is
-- simply a worse buy than another drill level.
-- Growth gems are the best money in the game and were being ignored.
--
-- They multiply ore REGENERATION, which is the exact thing every drone is
-- waiting on (all four report OreNotReady), and they apply themselves the moment
-- they are bought - no tool to equip, GrowthGemInventoryCount drops straight back
-- to zero and the tunnel's GrowthMultiplier attribute goes to the gem's value.

-- Showcase pedestals: the free one-hour money boost --------------------------------------
--
-- Two pedestals in the base grant a money multiplier, and getting one running is
-- THREE separate steps. The script only ever did the first, which is why the
-- multiplier sat at 1.00 for entire sessions and the pedestals looked broken:
--
--   1. UNLOCK    ShowcasePedestalAction("Purchase", n, baseName)
--   2. PLACE     hold the ore as a Tool, then fire the pedestal's
--                ShowcaseOrePrompt - the server takes whatever is EQUIPPED
--   3. ACTIVATE  ShowcasePedestalAction("ActivateBoost", n, baseName)
--
-- Note the argument order: the base name comes LAST on this remote while every
-- other remote in this game takes it first.
--
-- All of this was measured on Base3, 2026-09-06:
--
--   * placing a Stone Ore moved ShowcasePedestal1Multiplier from 1 to 1.02 and
--     left BoostExpiresAt at 0. The pedestal's own label says "Activate for
--     Money Boost!" - placing is not activating, and that is the step that was
--     missing.
--   * ActivateBoost answered success and set BoostExpiresAt to os.time() + 3598,
--     so the boost runs for ONE HOUR.
--   * the balance did not move by a single dollar: it is FREE. The only reason
--     to not call it is that it is already running.
--   * calling it again while it runs is a harmless no-op - success, same expiry,
--     no extension - so a missed pass costs nothing.
--   * a pedestal that has not been bought answers "Locked", which is a clean
--     gate and means the state never has to be guessed.
--
-- WHICH ore is on the pedestal decides the size of the multiplier, and the
-- spread is the whole point: ORES.ShowcaseMultipliersByOreName runs from Stone
-- Ore 1.02 to Adminite Ore 4.0 over 81 ores. Only ores lying SPARE in the
-- backpack are used - an ore in a tunnel is earning money there and is never
-- pulled out for this.
--
-- Everything below reads its state from the player's own attributes
-- (ShowcasePedestal<n>Unlocked / OreName / Multiplier / BoostExpiresAt), so a
-- pedestal that is unlocked and still inside its hour costs ZERO remote calls
-- per pass, however often the spend loop comes round.
