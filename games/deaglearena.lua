--[[ deaglearena.lua - "[EVENT] Deagle Arena" (public place 84556640895285)

  The fourth SHOOTER in this collection and the first one that is a FFA duel game
  rather than a team round game. Everything below was measured through the bridge
  before a line of this was written; where a number appears in this file it came
  off the running client, not off a guess.

  * **ONE SHOT IS ONE KILL.** `Modules.Shared.Config.Deagle` reads
    `Damage = 100`, `HitFireRate = 0.9`, `MissFireRate = 1.1`, and every
    character has `MaxHealth = 100`. So no body part does more damage than any
    other, health is a binary, and the resource that actually matters is the
    COOLDOWN - a miss costs 1.1s, a hit 0.9s.
  * **Therefore the head is the WRONG place to aim.** The hitboxes are
    `HeadHitbox` 3.23 x 3.25 x 3.23 and `BodyHitbox` 4.77 x 4.59 x 2.20, both
    invisible, both CanQuery. The body is the larger target and pays exactly the
    same 100 damage, so "Body" is the default here and the panel says why. Every
    published script for this game aims at the head.
  * **The lobby is full of BOTS and `Players:GetPlayers()` does not list them.**
    Measured on a live server: `#Players:GetPlayers()` is 1 while eight character
    models sit in the Workspace. Bots are plain Models parented straight into
    `workspace` carrying `IsBot = true`, `BotLevel`, `BotUserId`, `BotAiming`,
    `Elo`. `Matchmaking.NoBotsElo` is 1250, so above that rank they stop
    appearing. Any target list built from the Players service alone finds nobody
    at all, which is why the ESP here walks BOTH.
  * **The bullet ray is a shared module and this script uses the game's own.**
    `Modules.Shared.DeagleShared.Raycast(character, from, to)` casts 600 studs in
    up to 8 penetration passes, filtering the shooter, every Accessory of every
    living character, all dead bodies and anything tagged / named `InvisiblePart`.
    Calling it is exact rather than approximate: there is no ignore list to
    maintain and no clip-brush trap to fall into, because this IS the function the
    shot uses. 600 studs is also a hard weapon range - a target further away
    cannot be hit at all, so it is the ceiling on every distance slider here.
  * **The shot state is published by the client's own controller.**
    `PlayerScripts.ModuleLoader.DeagleController` carries `InGame`, `CanShoot`,
    `ShootCooldownUntil` and `IsAiming` as live fields. The trigger reads them, so
    it never clicks into a cooldown and never fires while you are in the menu, and
    the ADS gate is the real scope flag rather than a guess.
  * **Spawn protection is a real gate and it is readable.**
    `EffectsController.ProtectedPlayers[character]` is the exact table the game's
    own shot checks before it reports a hit, and the character attribute
    `SpawnProtection` mirrors it. Shooting a protected player does nothing but
    start your 1.1s miss cooldown, so both the aim and the trigger skip them.
  * **The state oracle is `ClientData.Data`** - Kills, Deaths, Elo, Rank, Streak,
    HighestStreak, Headshots, Level, Cash, Gems, Wins, Matches. It is mutated in
    place by the `UpdateData` client event, so the table stays valid; every
    before/after claim about this script is checked against it.
  * **The lobby and the match are DIFFERENT PLACES and the match place varies.**
    `Config.Matchmaking` holds `PublicPlaceId 84556640895285` and
    `RankedPlaceId 112087763192016`, and ranked additionally reserves servers. So
    the hub entry for this script must not be a place-id list: detection is
    content based (`Modules.Shared.DeagleShared` + `Modules.Shared.Config`), which
    matches in every place this game can throw you into.
  * **The camera write STICKS here.** Measured at `RenderPriority.Camera + 1`
    with `CameraType.Custom`: a 15 deg yaw write read 0.00 deg against the wanted
    CFrame and 15.00 deg against the previous one two frames later. So unlike
    BloxStrike the aim does not have to go through `mousemoverel` - but it still
    can, and the mouse path is kept as a dropdown because it is the one that
    survives a game update turning the camera controller authoritative.
  * **Recoil is a single spring impulse, not a spray pattern.**
    `CameraController.Shoot` does `spring:AddVelocity(0.017)` on a
    `Spring.new(4, 12, 300, ...)` and applies the offset as pitch, which then
    settles back to zero by itself. With one shot per ~1s there is no spray to
    control, so this script ships NO recoil-control page. What it does ship is the
    measurement, on the AIM page, so the claim can be checked rather than believed.

  Nothing here hooks anything of the game and nothing fabricates a hit. The shot
  path is `Network:FireServer("Shoot", origin, aimPoint, hitInstance, hitPosition)`
  - the client reports which part it hit - and this script deliberately does not
  touch it. The aim moves the view and the trigger presses the real mouse button,
  so whatever the server validates it validates an ordinary shot.

  The ONE remote this file fires is `RedeemCode`, behind a button the user
  presses, with the same payload the game's own Claim button sends.

-- This game already parents a Highlight into every character itself, so an extra
-- one in the model would be indistinguishable from the game's own AND would sit
-- in the tree where a client script can walk onto it. Ours goes to
-- gethui()/CoreGui with an Adornee: identical rendering, not in the game tree.

-- WHERE the Highlight lives is not a detail, and getting it wrong took the whole
-- ESP down rather than just the chams.
--
-- Parenting into gethui() is the right answer when it is allowed: the instance is
-- then outside the game tree where no client script can walk onto it. But it is
-- not always allowed. Loaded through `bridge.py file` the chunk runs with reduced
-- capabilities, and `hl.Parent = <folder under gethui()>` threw
-- "The current thread cannot access 'Instance' (lacking capability Plugin)".
--
-- The bug that made that expensive was not the throw, it was WHERE it was caught:
-- nowhere. chamFor is called from the middle of the per-target loop in
-- renderPass, so one failing Highlight aborted the entire render pass and the
-- box, the name, the distance and everything else stopped drawing with it. That
-- is exactly what it looked like from the outside - reported as "after switching
-- from the lobby into a round the ESP stops working and you have to toggle it off
-- and on again", because switching in brings new characters, which is the first
-- time chamFor is called for them, and toggling chams off is what let the pass
-- finish again.
--
-- So: the container is resolved once with fallbacks, every instance touch is
-- guarded, and a failure disables the chams and SAYS SO on the panel instead of
-- taking the drawings with it.

-- EVERY instance touch in here is inside a pcall, including the ones that look

-- exactly like parenting into it does, and `gethui()` itself can throw - so a
-- guard that only wraps the create call still lets the error out through its own
-- freshness check. That is how the first version of this fix still took the
-- render pass down.
--
-- The candidate list is built by APPENDING rather than as a table literal:
-- `{ (gethui and gethui()) or nil, CoreGui }` is the nil-hole trap - on an
-- executor with no gethui the table is `{nil, CoreGui}` and ipairs stops at the

-- silent shot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- This is the one place in the file that fires the shot remote instead of
-- pressing the mouse, and it is here because it was MEASURED to work rather than
-- assumed to.
--
-- What the client normally sends is
--   Network:FireServer("Shoot", cameraPosition, mouseWorldPoint, hitInstance, hitPosition)
-- where hitInstance and hitPosition come from the client's OWN raycast. The
-- server takes the reported part at face value: a shot naming a hitbox 64.6 deg
-- behind the camera killed, and so did one naming a hitbox 164 studs away behind
-- a wall - both confirmed on ClientData.Data.Kills, which is the server's total,
-- rather than on a client-side effect.
--
-- Three consequences worth being plain about:
--
--   * The camera is never touched, so there is nothing to see on a killcam as
--     camera movement - but the shot itself is as loud as any other, and a
--     server-side look at who died from where would find it at once. It ships
--     OFF and it is in none of the presets.
--   * The client's own DeagleController is not involved, so `CanShoot` never
--     goes false and `shotReady()` cannot pace this. The loop keeps its own
--     timer, and it has to: three shots 0.15s apart produced exactly one kill.
--   * Firing while the player also clicks WASTES shots - both land inside the
--     same cooldown and the server keeps one. The panel says so next to the
--     switch rather than leaving it to be discovered.
