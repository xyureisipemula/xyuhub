    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An aura-wall ladder bolted onto a carry-and-place plot income game. The
    walls are the game's own progression gate and the whole point of this
    script is that the SERVER DOES NOT ENFORCE THEM for pickups - it only
    enforces them for unlocking the next world.

    The loop, measured through the bridge on 2026-08-20:

      pick the richest SpawnedItem in workspace.ItemSpawners.<Rarity>
        -> pin the root part on it ~1.1s, fireproximityprompt("Pick Up")
        -> it lands in Character.Gripped (carried) or, once MaxCarry is full,
           in the Backpack as a Tool
        -> pin on a plot slot's Spawn part, fire its ProximityPrompt
        -> firetouchinterest on every Slot.YourPadPart.CollectTouch, from
           anywhere, to bank the money

    Verified facts this script is built on (do not re-derive):

      * THERE IS NO ZONE GATE ON PICKUP. A Celestial DolphiniJetskini
        (2.5e25/s) was taken from x = -2366, behind all 21 walls, while the
        player stood at wall 2 with $0. That single item paid 3.5e26 within
        seconds. The walls are physical barriers only.
      * The bat is decoration. BatHitBindable.BatSwingRemote:FireServer()
        takes no arguments and 65 swings at a wall did EXACTLY 0 damage.
        Wall damage is passive and proximity-based: 5s standing at a wall did
        44 damage at PlayerDamage 5 (~1.76 ticks/s), 5s from 1400 studs did 0.
        Standing still IS the input.
      * BUT THE BAT MUST STAY IN INVENTORY SLOT 1. Never RequestSell
        ("Inventory") - that sells the whole backpack and the bat with it.
        Only RequestSell("Equipped"), and only ever with a brainrot held.
      * PLACING NEEDS THE ITEM EQUIPPED AS A TOOL. Firing a slot's prompt
        while the item merely sits in the backpack moves it nowhere; it reads
        exactly like a broken place remote. Humanoid:EquipTool(tool) first.
        Something still in Character.Gripped is already "held" and needs no
        equip.
      * AN OCCUPIED SLOT'S PROMPT PICKS UP, IT DOES NOT SWAP. ActionText
        "Pick Up / Swap" is a lie: the first fire pulls the seated item out,
        and only a SECOND fire seats what is held. Firing once and walking
        away leaves the slot empty and both items loose.
      * Collecting is NOT position gated - 5.5e26 banked from 1614 studs.
        Selling is not either - RequestSell("Equipped") worked from 1400.
      * Slot upgrade is the strongest sink in the game by a wide margin:
        RequestSlotUpgrade(FloorName, SlotName), income x1.2 and price x1.5
        per level. Level 1 -> 2 cost 8.96e24 and paid +2.66e25/s, a 0.34s
        payback. There is no throttle at all - 300 fires in a row all landed
        (income moved exactly x1.2^10). Payback only reaches ~165s around
        level 50.
      * TWO INCOME SCALES, AND MIXING THEM BREAKS THE SWAP LOGIC. The
        VisualItem's Earning attribute is base x mutation x slot level x
        rebirth multiplier x world multiplier; ItemConfigurations.Items[n]
        .Income is the raw base. Ranking a candidate's raw value against a
        placed item's Earning makes every placed item look ~300x better and
        nothing is ever swapped in. Everything here compares RAW values:
        Income x mutation x the world the item was caught in.
      * A FRESHLY PLACED ITEM HAS Earning = 0 FOR A MOMENT. Reading that as
        its value ranks it as the weakest slot, and the very next iteration
        throws it straight back out - a Diamond 3e25 was evicted for a Golden
        1e25 that way, then sold. slotValue() therefore always computes from
        the config and never trusts a zero.
      * Mutation multipliers, measured off Earning/base: Normal 1, Golden 2,
        Diamond 3, Galaxy 4, Lava 5. Rainbow (0.5% chance) never dropped and
        is priced HIGH on purpose - an unknown mutation valued at 1 is how a
        Galaxy earning 540M/s got thrown away in wingsbrainrots.
      * WORLDS ARE THE BIGGEST LEVER IN THE GAME and they multiply brainrot
        income: Forest 1, Galaxy x100, Candy x1e3, Heaven x1e4, Summer x1e5,
        Magmatic x1e6, Iceberg x1e7. TeleportWorld:FireServer(<world NAME>).
        The multiplier applies to items CAUGHT IN THAT WORLD, not to the plot
        - a fresh world-2 item on slot level 1 already beats a world-1 item on
        slot level 24, so a world jump means re-farming all 30 slots.
      * UNLOCKING A WORLD NEEDS THE WALLS ACTUALLY BROKEN. The server answers
        "Reach the end of the map to unlock a new world!" and a glide to
        x = -7434 with the walls still standing changed nothing. Break all 21,
        then travel to the end of the corridor - a single CFrame warp does not
        register, a per-Heartbeat glide does.
      * Wall HP scales with the world: Worlds[n].WallMult is 1, 1e3, 1e6, 1e9,
        1e12, 1e15, 1e18. Forest wall 21 is 2.6e15.
      * AURA: PurchaseAuraUpgrade:FireServer(n) ACCEPTS ONLY 1, 5 OR 10 - the
        three shop buttons. 25/50/100/250 are silently dropped. The shop's
        CurrentStrength is the LEVEL (purchase count); PlayerDamage is
        4.7 * e^(0.0536*level). Damage grows x1.057 per unit, price x1.125 per
        level, so the price eventually outruns the damage. A purchase that is
        not affordable is refused SILENTLY - that reads exactly like a dead
        remote, so always confirm on PlayerDamage.
      * Aura skins are a separate damage multiplier:
        AuraSkinEvent:FireServer("EquipAuraOrBuy", name), cash. Basic 1 ->
        Perdurple 4.75 (5e26) with rebirth-gated tiers above. It does NOT show
        up in PlayerDamage - it is applied server side at hit time.
        "BuyRobuxAura" is the paid path and is never fired.
      * REBIRTH NEEDS THE REQUIREMENT ITEM PLACED ON THE PLOT, not merely
        owned. Holding a LiriliLarila and firing RequestRebirth did nothing;
        seating it on a slot and firing worked immediately. The gate is
        Informations.RebirthRequiers[n] = {Aura = <log level>, Item, MoneyMult}
        and rebirth resets aura and speed but keeps money, plot and items.
      * The farm loop must not evict its own staged rebirth item. The first
        version seated Item67 and then swapped a SmurfCat over it in the same
        pass, forever. census() excludes the requirement item from the
        eviction list.
      * Functions.GetProfile:InvokeServer() hands the client the COMPLETE
        ProfileStore profile - Data holds Money, Rebirths, Damage, Speed,
        MaxCarry, BaseLevel, Plots, Inventory. Every RemoteFunction here goes
        through task.spawn plus a wall clock cap; a parked InvokeServer takes
        the bridge poll with it.
      * leaderstats.Money is a StringValue for display. The real number is the
        player attribute MoneyNumber.
      * Prices in the UI are abbreviated with the game's own ladder
        (N = 1e30, De = 1e33, Ud = 1e36 ...). parsePrice uses that table,
        cross-checked against Modules.NumberFormatter.Format.

    Robux, never touched: every BuyRobux button beside a cash one, the
    rebirth Skip product, "BuyRobuxAura", 2xCash / SuperLuck / 2xStrength,
    the x2 buttons and the shop's lucky block tiers.
