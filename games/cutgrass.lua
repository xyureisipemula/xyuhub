--[[ cutgrass.lua - "+1 Cut Grass Adventure" (place 90086669327265)

  The loop the game actually runs:

      CLICK                 -> Strength   (argument-less, server cooldown 0.08s)
      stand on a TRAIN PAD  -> Strength   (+multiplier every 0.5s, and it STACKS
                                           with clicking - measured, see below)
      Strength IS the damage that cuts GRASS; every zone's grass has a fixed
      health, 50 in zone 1 up to 700 BILLION in zone 15
      behind the grass lies LOOT          -> carried in a 3-slot backpack
      loot is SOLD for Money              -> cutters (DamageMult), auras, upgrades
      Rebirth (level 25)                  -> multipliers and the next train pads
      five worlds, gated on the PLAYER LEVEL (185 / 380 / 570 / 750)

  ============================================================================
  READ THIS FIRST: THIS GAME HAS A REAL ANTI-CHEAT, AND IT IS A GOOD ONE
  ============================================================================

  `ReplicatedStorage.Shared.Configs.AntiCheat` is 200 lines of a properly built
  detection system with a ban DataStore, a suspect registry keyed by risk score
  and an admin tool that bulk-bans 100 accounts in one press. Three checks:

  * HONEYPOT - twenty decoy remotes, and ONE call is an immediate detect at
    risk 100. No accumulation, no grace. They sit in `DataService.RE` under
    exactly the names a farm script reaches for first: AddMoney, SetCash,
    GiveCoins, SetCurrency, ClaimMoney, ClaimAllRewards, SellAll,
    CollectAllLoot, RebirthAll, UpgradeAll, TrainAll and the rest. They do
    nothing except mark the account. Every remote this file fires was read out
    of the game's OWN controllers first (`Shared.Controllers.*`, all
    decompilable) so that only calls a real client makes are ever sent, and
    `fire()` below additionally refuses the whole list by name at runtime.

  * MOVEMENT - a 0.2s sample of speed and teleports, risk 70. A jump of 120
    studs or more is never excused by latency, sustained speed above about
    1.15x walkspeed over a 2s window is not either, and writing
    `Humanoid.WalkSpeed` is its own detection. **So this script never warps and
    never writes WalkSpeed.** Everything moves through `Humanoid:MoveTo`, which
    is the character walking at the speed the server issued it. Measured: base
    to zone 1 is 100 studs in 4.3s, 23 studs/s, entirely clean.

  * GRASSNOCLIP - walking through grass that is still standing for you, risk 80.
    The game puts a client-side blocker part (`_GD_GrassBlocker`) in front of
    uncut grass, and that blocker is the thing keeping this check quiet. This
    script leaves it alone. It is a guard, not an obstacle.

  As of the last read every check is `DetectionEnabled = true` with
  `PunishmentMode = "Warn"` and `EnforcementEnabled = false`, so a detection
  costs nothing TODAY - but it is written into `CutGrassAntiCheatSuspects_v3`
  with a risk score and that list is what the bulk-ban tool reads. Being
  recorded is a deferred bill, not a free pass.

  The server pushes `AntiCheatService.IncidentWarning` at the client it caught,
  so this panel listens for it: one warning switches AUTO off, stops every loop
  and prints what was detected. If that ever fires, something in here is wrong -
  read the note and say so, do not turn it back on.

  ============================================================================
  MEASURED, ALL AGAINST SERVER-SIDE VALUES
  ============================================================================

  * Idle gains nothing. 3s with no calls = 0 strength.

  * `StrengthService.ClickRequested:Fire()` takes no arguments. 1047 calls in 6s
    credited 70 strength = 11.66/s, which is `Strength.ClickCooldownSeconds`
    0.08 almost exactly. **12.5/s is the entire budget** and one call per frame
    wastes 93% of them, so this file paces the click at 0.075s instead of
    hammering it - flooding a remote is also what silently queued every other
    call in Training To Climb for four minutes.

  * Training pads and clicking STACK, which is the opposite of heroevo. Measured
    on the free x1.5 pad: pad alone 2.75 strength/s (11 pulses of 1.5 in 6s, the
    0.5s TickSeconds), clicking alone 11.66/s, both together 13.37/s. So the
    body belongs on a pad whenever it is not cutting, and the click loop never
    stops. Free pads are gated on the rebirth count (x1.5 at 0, x2 at 2, x4 at
    5, x6 at 8 ... x45 at 36); every pad carrying a `GamepassId` (x10, x25,
    x100, x300, x1000) is skipped on the FIELD, never on the name.

  * `AttackService.AttackRequested:Fire()` takes no arguments either - the
    server sweeps around your own position, `Attack.PlayerCoverageRadius` 6 plus
    a forward sweep of up to 10 studs. The cooldown is a hard 0.5s: fired at
    0.25s intervals exactly every second call came back
    `AttackPerformed(false, 0)`.

  * Grass health is the whole gate, and it is a table:
    `Zone.GrassHealthByIndex` = 50, 500, 3000, 15000, 60000, 300000, 1.49M,
    8.36M, 46M, 248M, 1.32B, 6.99B, 36.5B, 90B, 700B ... over 57 zones.
    Measured in zone 1 at strength 476: one blade per hit, 13 blades in 14
    attacks while walking. Measured in zone 2 (500 HP) at strength 120: 34
    accepted attacks, 3 blades. The zone picker below does NOT hardcode a
    damage formula for this - it LEARNS the frontier from whether a trip
    actually cut anything, which is the ladder algorithm from CLAUDE.md.

  * **GRASS IS CUT ONCE AND STAYS CUT, and the StartLine does NOT undo that.**
    This one was read wrong first and the mistake is worth keeping written down.
    `Worlds.World_<n>.Safe_Zone_0.StartLine` is a 1x1x400 plane at x = -840.1 in
    world 1, and stepping back across it really does run
    `RestoreAllLocalGrass()` - measured, 646 blades in zone 1 with 112 cut went
    to 0 cut the moment the body crossed at x = -845.3. But that function only
    clears the CLIENT attribute. The server keeps its own copy, so what actually
    happens is that the client redraws a full field the server still has as
    mown: nothing blocks the body any more and every swing comes back
    `AttackPerformed(true, 0)`. Measured both ways - zone 1 after a local
    restore, 24 accepted attacks, **0** blades; zone 2, never touched, 16
    accepted attacks, **31** blades and two grass lines opened.

    So cutting is PERMANENT PROGRESS, not a lap. There is no going back and
    nothing here waits at the start line; the frontier only ever moves forward.

  * **The income is the LOOT, and that is what respawns.** Once a zone's grass is
    open the farm is a patrol of its SpawnZone, not another walk through the
    field. That is why the cutting pass fires only while the frontier is behind
    the target and the loot patrol gets the body the rest of the time.

  * Loot carries its whole record as attributes on the world model:
    `LootId`, `LootRarity`, `LootSellPrice`, `LootZoneIndex` and
    **`LootExpiresAt`** - it despawns, so the picker skips anything about to go.
    Pickup is a plain `PickupPrompt` with `MaxActivationDistance` 5; walk inside
    3.5 studs and fire it once. Confirmed by `LootService.LootPickedUp`, never
    by the prompt returning.

  * **`DataService:SellAllBackpackLoot()` is NOT position gated.** Three items
    sold from 133 studs away from the market for $405, `MoneyRaw` 105 -> 510. So
    there are no return trips in this script at all; the only walk back is the
    one that restores the grass.

  * The backpack starts at 3 slots (`GetBackpackSlotsState().Capacity`) and the
    Carry upgrade raises it. That cap is the reason loot is ranked on
    `LootSellPrice` rather than on distance.

  Never spends Robux: every honeypot remote above, the five gamepass training
  pads, `BuyCutterRobux`, `RobuxCarryButtonClicked` /
  `WalkSpeedRobuxButtonClicked` / `AttackSpeedRobuxButtonClicked` /
  `AttackRangeRobuxButtonClicked`, `RebirthRobuxButtonClicked`, the auras' and
  cutters' `RobuxPrice` (that field is only the OTHER way to pay for the same
  money-priced item - same trap as speedmonkey's trails), `QuestRewardsService
  .Purchase`, every Relics skip/guarantee product and the Lucky Wheel's paid
  spins.
