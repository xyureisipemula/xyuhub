    speedtrain.lua - "Speed Training / Geschwindigkeitstraining" (place 105553804282308)

    Measured against server-side values on 2026-08-23, account hallowasgehtz2,
    from a completely fresh save (0 wins, 0 rebirths, Speed 100).

    THE GAME
    Two engines that do not run at the same time, because there is one body:

      * TRAINING - stand on a treadmill, Speed ticks up.  Speed is the rebirth
        currency AND the thing that sets how fast you may legally run in a race.
      * RACING - every ~120s a race window opens (`Values.RaceActive`, ~15s
        break between).  Running down the track pays Wins at 16 milestones.
        Wins buy shoes, trails, partners, eggs and unlock the eight worlds.
        Gems from the same milestones buy the upgrade ladder.

    HOW THE RACE IS SCORED, AND THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS
    `Modules.Shared.RaceLib.GetStudsTraveled` runs on the SERVER and reads the
    character's own position:

        studs = max(HumanoidRootPart.Position.Z - 114, 0) * DistanceNerf
                + Laps * finalMilestoneStuds

    so the distance is whatever the client's position says it is.  Two rules
    were paid for with a lot of dead races:

      1. **You have to come through the start line.**  `Join Race` is only
         accepted from the race proximity pad, which sits at Z ~= 105, i.e.
         BEHIND the gate at Z = 114, and the run only counts if the body then
         moves forward from there.  Teleporting straight to Z = 100120 (the
         end of the world-1 track, 600,036 studs) put a perfect 600,043 into
         `DistanceHighScores` and paid **nothing** - the milestones are only
         handed out for a run that started at the line.  This was the single
         biggest time sink in the whole session.
      2. **There is a speed ceiling and it is not a position check.**  With
         `TopSpeed` at 34.3 (a fresh account), moving Z at 300 studs/s - about
         7x the legitimate race speed - credited **every** milestone it passed,
         exactly at the listed value.  At 900 studs/s the server paid out
         milestone 5 and then stopped for the rest of the race.  So the boost
         is a MULTIPLE of what the game itself would run at, never a constant:
         `Humanoid.WalkSpeed * 3 / DistanceNerf` is the game's own forward
         speed and `CONFIG.boostFactor` is how much of it we take.  The factor
         tunes itself down whenever a milestone is passed and not paid.

    Measured, world 1, 120s race at 300 studs/s: milestones 1..12 = **+4,206
    wins in one race**, every single one credited at its listed value
    (25,000 studs -> +8, 37,500 -> +10, 50,000 -> +25, 70,000 -> +50, ...).
    The full track is 600,000 studs and worth 91,456 wins; world 8 pays 100x
    the same ladder.

    OTHER THINGS THAT ARE TRUE HERE
    * The whole game is the **Paper** library, same as Pickaxe Simulator: every
      action is `Paper.Network.FireServer(name, ...)` /
      `InvokeServer(name, ...)` with a plain English name, multiplexed through
      `ReplicatedStorage.Paper.Remotes.__remoteevent` / `__remotefunction`.
    * The state oracle is `Paper.Stats.GetValue(player, key)` - 160 fields,
      everything from `Wins` and `Speed` to `BoughtShoes` and `WorldsUnlocked`.
      Read it through the accessor every time; the underlying table is replaced
      by the server, not mutated.
    * **`FireServer("Use Treadmill", n)` needs no walking at all** - it warps
      the body onto treadmill n from anywhere, and it works even while a race
      is running.  `TreadmillLib.CanUse(plr, n)` is the honest gate (Speed
      requirement AND rebirth requirement).
    * Rebirth costs **Speed**, not wins: `500 * (rebirths + 1) * amount`
      (`Modules.Shared.Rebirths`).  It is linear, so banking and converting in
      one batch costs the same as converting one at a time and only pays the
      Speed reset once.  `InvokeServer("Rebirth", amount)`; the "Max" button in
      the game is gamepass-gated but the remote takes any amount.
    * Shoes are a flat purchase, not a ladder - `Buy Shoe` for "Striped
      Sandals" went through while "Blue Sneaker" was worn and charged exactly
      its 2,500 - and the fields mean: `WalkSpeed` raw race speed, `Wins` +%
      wins, `Luck` +% egg luck, `Acceleration` +% acceleration.
    * Worlds unlock themselves once total wins pass `Worlds[n].Req`
      (7,500 / 1M / 50M / 10B / 200B / 2.5T / 20T); `Set Current World` then
      answers for anything `WorldsUnlocked` covers.  Each world ships its own
      milestone table with the world multiplier already baked in.
    * Every upgrade is priced in **Gems**, and gems only come out of race
      milestones.  `More Wins` and `More Speed` start at 15 / 10 gems.
    * Free and verified: `Claim Free Reward`, `Claim Daily`,
      `Redeem Code("update6")` (gave 4 Win Potions, a Speed and a Luck Potion),
      `Claim Chest`, `Claim Achievement`, `Claim Group` (needs the group).
    * Robux, never touched: every `ProductId` shoe / trail / partner
      (Prismatic Boots, Rainbow trail, 1x1x1x1, ...), the exclusive eggs,
      `Revenue Metadata`, DoubleSpeed2Min, the max-rebirth and auto-rebirth
      gamepasses, `TwelveHatchProduct`.
