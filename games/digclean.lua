--
-- Loop: a detector reveals buried nodes in a dig area, you dig one out, spray it
-- clean, and then either sell it or put it on a pedestal in your museum where
-- tourists pay for it. Gold buys better shovels, sprays and detectors.
--
-- The game is roblox-ts with a proper network layer, so nothing here had to be
-- captured off the wire: `PlayerScripts.TS.network.<X>Network` exports typed
-- client wrappers and every remote is named in plain English.
--
--   local Items = require(plr.PlayerScripts.TS.network.ItemsNetwork)
--   Items.ItemsFunctions.beginCleaning:invoke(uid)   -- promise, :expect()
--   Items.ItemsEvents.finishCleaning:fire(uid)
--
-- Measured, all of it, against DataFunctions.requestDataUpdate (the state oracle
-- - Gold, Level, Xp, Inventory, Owned*, Equipped*, UnlockedIslands, ItemsDug):
--
--   * Dig: DigController:attemptDig() then :onDigInput() per click. One node took
--     5.2s at 11 clicks/s. DiggingConfig.DIG_MAX_CLICKS_PER_SECOND is 50, so the
--     rate here is well inside it.
--   * Clean: beginCleaning(uid) then finishCleaning(uid) 0.35s later finishes the
--     item in 2.0s and SKIPS the spray minigame outright.
--   * Sell: sellInventory() answered 474 gold for one item.
--   * Museum: a single Duck on pedestal 1 carried Gold 174 -> 2472 while one dig
--     was running. Tourists pay for what is on display, so the best finds stay.
--
-- Three server-side PROXIMITY rules, each of which fails as a silent `false`
-- rather than an error - that is what makes them expensive to find:
--   * buyGear(category, id) - positional, category "shovel", only at the GearNPC
--   * sellInventory()       - only at the SellerNPC
--   * placeItem(slot, uid)  - only on your own plot
--
-- And the gate that costs a whole evening if it is missed: **no buried node ever
-- spawns until the tutorial is finished**. GetTutorialState().step has to read 11.
-- Step 3 is "Click anywhere to start digging" and mouse1click() does not satisfy
-- it - the click has to go through the controller's own handler.
--
-- No anti-cheat exists in this game: no warning event, no audit flags, no
-- position validation. The only limiter is TS.utils.security.RateLimit and the
-- click ceiling above. Nothing here needs to fight anything.
--
-- Never touched, all Robux: the gamepass shop, ForeverPack/StarterPack/ExpertPack,
-- SkipPolishTiers, ItemRecovery, gifts and every `setGearPurchaseIntent` prompt.

-- what a find costs in seconds
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- A dig is a race between `clickPower` per counted click and a `decay` per second,
-- and both come out of DiggingConfig.digDifficultyFor(itemId, kg, shovelPower). The
-- bar starts at DIG_PROGRESS_START and has to reach DIG_WIN_THRESHOLD, so with a
-- click rate of `cps` the whole thing collapses to one number per rarity:
--
--   seconds = (0.985 - 0.33) / (clickPower * cps - decay)
--
-- and if that denominator is not positive the find is simply out of reach. Measured
-- off the game's own config (median item of each band at its averageKg), the
-- break-even click rate decay/clickPower reads:
--
--   shovel      common uncommon rare  epic  legend mythic divine+
--   plastic p1    4.0     16.5  27.1  38.5   51.2   61.9   80.6
--   metal   p5    1.0      1.3   2.5  13.3   27.1   31.7   39.1
--   titanium p14  0.8      0.8   1.3   2.8    7.9   17.4   24.6
--   diamond p40   0.8      0.8   0.8   1.2    1.4    1.7    5.6
--
-- Which is why "rarest first" is right with a diamond shovel and ruinous with a
-- plastic one, and why "possible" is not the same question as "worth it": at 35
-- clicks a second a plastic shovel CAN take a rare, and a measured run spent the
-- whole 20-second dig timeout doing it and came away with one item in 105 seconds.
