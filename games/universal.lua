--[[ universal.lua - the fallback for a shooter this hub does not know

  Loaded by hub/loader.lua when nothing in index.json matches the place. It is
  deliberately the SMALLEST thing that still works everywhere:

    * ESP drawn with the Drawing library
    * a camera-side aim assist with TWO delivery paths and runtime detection of
      which one this game accepts

  Neither needs a remote, a module or any reverse engineering. They read
  Instances and they move the view, and that part of Roblox is the same in every
  shooter. Everything that needs per-game knowledge - firing, recoil patterns,
  silent aim, NPC enemies, round state - is deliberately NOT here, because a
  universal version of it would be a universal lie.

  ============================================================================
  WHAT "SAFE" MEANS HERE, because the two halves are not comparable
  ============================================================================

  ESP is genuinely unseeable. Drawing objects live in the executor's overlay and
  never enter the DataModel, so there is no Instance for a client script to find
  with one GetDescendants() call, nothing replicates and the server is never
  contacted. That is why this file contains no Highlight, no BillboardGui and no
  recoloured parts - a Highlight you create IS findable, and repainting real
  parts is visible to other players in some games.

  The aim assist cannot be hidden by any client-side trick, and pretending
  otherwise would be the dangerous lie. A shooter that records view angles
  server-side - BloxStrike does it at 128 Hz - holds a replayable recording of
  where the crosshair was, tick by tick. A snap onto a head, a superhuman turn
  rate or tracking through a wall is computable after the fact no matter what
  the client does. So the assist's safety is ENTIRELY the shape of its motion:
  the reaction delay, the wind-up, the degrees-per-second ceiling, the deadzone
  and the wander. Those defaults are the safety feature; the presets exist so
  they are not forty unlabelled sliders.

  For the same reason the default delivery is the MOUSE where the game accepts
  it: `mousemoverel` goes through the real input path, so the game's own camera
  controller authors the movement. A CFrame write is a camera teleport that the
  controller did not author.

  ============================================================================
  THE FOUR THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO SURVIVE, each measured in a real game
  ============================================================================

  1. TEAMS THAT ARE PRESENT BUT EMPTY. "DoW: WWII - Mobile 2" has Allies and
     Axis in Teams, zero players in either and the local player Neutral; a plain
     `p.Team ~= plr.Team` marks nobody and the script sits silent in exactly the
     game it was written for. BloxStrike is the other shape: Teams is empty and
     the team is an ATTRIBUTE. teamsLookReal() decides whether the field can be
     believed at all and otherwise treats everyone as a target.

  2. RIGS THAT ARE NOT R15, AND HITBOXES THAT ARE NOT THE HEAD. R6 has Torso and
     no UpperTorso. Plenty of games ship their own aim hitboxes - DoW carries
     AutoAimAreaHead / AutoAimAreaBody, which are BETTER targets than the visible
     head because they are what the game itself shoots at. Counter Blox has
     HeadHB for the same reason. resolveParts() looks for those first.

  3. A BOX FROM Model:GetBoundingBox() THAT IS NONSENSE. Measured in Counter
     Blox: 30 x 77 x 32 studs for a character whose real extent is 2.3 x 6.5 x
     2.5 - boxes covering half the screen that barely shrink with distance.
     Measured in DoW the same call is almost exact (5.0 x 7.0 x 5.5 against
     5.0 x 7.0 x 5.0). So it is not always wrong, it is UNRELIABLE, and when it
     is wrong it is wrong by a factor of ten. The head-to-foot projection is
     used wherever the parts exist and the bounding box is only a sanity-checked
     last resort for a rig nothing else recognises.

  4. A CAMERA THE GAME FIGHTS FOR. BloxStrike rebuilds camera.CFrame every frame
     from angles it keeps itself: the write is thrown away on the next frame,
     measured at ~220 px of error across 2183 frames that never once converged,
     and it reads to the user as "it shakes and gets worse the further off I am".
     DoW, measured with the same probe, keeps 395 of 478 writes inside 0.1 deg.
     Both are normal. So the script PROBES instead of assuming, and switches to
     the mouse path when the camera path is being overwritten.

--   COVERAGE  it answers for more than half the live players. One lucky hit
--             among eleven blanks is noise wearing a result's clothes.
--   ANCHOR    it can say which side is MINE - either because it answers for me
