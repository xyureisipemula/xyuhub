--[[ strengthclick.lua - "[💪] +1 Strength Per Click" (place 120766736586332)

  The loop the game actually runs:

      click  -> Strength -> Level  (Level is what makes a click worth more)
      Strength -> break the walls of your lane -> the lane advances by ITSELF
      the win pad at the end of a lane pays BaseConfig.Wins[lane] and ends the run
      Wins -> title rolls, upgrades, eggs, and rebirths (1000 Wins = 1 Rebirth)
      Rebirths -> stronger training zones -> a permanent strength multiplier

  Everything below was measured through the bridge before it was written down.
  The five findings that shape this file:

  * ClickRemote:FireServer() takes no arguments, has no position check and - unlike
    every other clicker in this repo - NO server throttle. 40 calls/s credited 240
    of 240; 25 calls per frame still credited every one. The ceiling is the client
    frame rate (~75 calls/s), so more than a handful per frame buys nothing.

  * CLEARING A LANE'S WALLS ADVANCES THE LANE ON ITS OWN. Measured: Lane3 -> Lane8
    in 21 seconds without ever touching a win pad. The first version of this loop
    claimed after every lane and earned 3 wins/s; climbing first and claiming once
    at the bottom earned 1500 wins in a single touch. Never claim early.

  * The win pad pays Wins[the lane you are CURRENTLY in] and does not care whether
    that lane's walls are broken - a run that stalled on Lane8 still paid its full
    1500 - and it resets you to Lane1. So a run ends on a STALL, not on a timer.
    firetouchinterest reaches it from 183 studs; no walking.

  * Walls are hit by the game's OWN client loop (WallClient raycasts 20 studs down
    -Z into workspace.Stage[Lane]), so standing in front of a wall is the whole
    input. DamageWall:FireServer() is fired here as well, but SERVER_HIT_COOLDOWN
    is 0.4s, which also caps the Punch Speed upgrade at level 10 (value 2.5).

  * Rebirth converts ALL wins at once: 2121 wins became 2 rebirths and the 121
    remainder was destroyed. Since the rate is linear, banking to a milestone and
    rebirthing once costs the same wins but only one strength reset. The milestones
    are the training zones: 1, 25, 200, 5000, 100000, 10000000 rebirths.

  * The training multiplier only applies WHILE the body stands in the zone, and it
    drops back to 1 the moment the climb warps away - so the run is two phases,
    train then climb, not one. (It looked sticky at first only because the test
    disconnected the pin without ever moving the character out.) A zone above your
    rebirth count sets the multiplier to 1, which is worse than entering none at
    all; the gamepass zones (x3, x10, x250) carry Rebirth = 99999999999999 and are
    filtered by that attribute, never by name.

  Four things the game gives away, all measured against the server's own oracle:

  * THE CLICK UPGRADER IS A BALANCE REQUIREMENT, NOT A COST. The pads in
    workspace.StrengthBoosts read "+3K/Click - 100K Wins Required"; touching one
    from 47 studs set BaseStrength 2 -> 3000 and charged ZERO wins, and the tier
    survived the balance falling back under the requirement. Per click went from
    12,159 to 9,865,440 - an 811x, and it was the single biggest thing missing
    from the first version of this file. The model names lie (the second floor has
    five models called "+3MStrength" worth +2.5M to +100M), so both the gain and
    the price are read off the labels.

  * THE PAID TITLE ROLLS ARE FREE. TitleRoll:FireServer takes the roll TYPE, and
    "Golden" / "Diamond" / "Neon" are the Robux tiers - fired directly they cost
    nothing at all. 22 free Neon rolls produced Reality Breaker, the best title in
    the game: x20 strength and x7 WINS, confirmed on GetPlayerData. Titles are
    owned forever and the server always applies the best one, so a roll can never
    be a downgrade.

  * THE ROBUX EGG IS PRICED IN WINS. HatchPet("Robux", n, {}) charges 99 WINS, not
    99 Robux, and hands out the premium pets - Nyan Cat x3.2 against x1.6 for the
    500-wins Basic egg and x7.5 for the 500-MILLION Desert egg. The amount argument
    is capped at 10 per call and charged correctly. Pets are additive
    (PetMultiplier = 1 + sum of (multiplier - 1) over the equipped ones) and three
    identical pets craft into one of the next tier at x1.5.

  * AN AURA ROLL CAN BE PREVIEWED BEFORE IT IS KEPT. The server charges on Roll but
    only APPLIES the result once the client sends RollVisualFinished - so the
    result arrives on RollVisual first and only the good ones are confirmed. Bubble
    (5%, the best in pack 1) landed on the second roll and nothing can downgrade
    the worn aura any more. Six rolls without the confirmation earlier spent 6000
    wins for nothing, which is what pointed at it.

  Probed and NOT exploitable, so nobody re-derives them: worlds (the World2..5
  attributes gate RequestTeleportServer, and firing it with a locked place id just
  rejoins the same place), Cmdr (registered with giveWins/giveStrength but every
  command answers "You don't have permission"), the "Robux" argument of BuyUpgrade
  and TeleportToLane (ignored, nothing charged, no prompt), ToggleAutoClick,
  UnlockTitle, a spoofed aura pack number, a hatch amount above 10, and codes -
  the server answers "Invalid code" to everything except WELCOME.

  Never spends Robux: every Buy*Strength / BuyMultiplier / Buy*Roll / BuyRobuxEgg /
  SkipRebirth / BuyPotion remote (those are the real purchase prompts and are not
  touched), the "Robux" argument of BuyUpgrade and TeleportToLane, and any egg
  bought through the shop rather than hatched.
