--[[ ttk.lua - "TTK Testing" by Sable Digital (place 120189115846709)

  The fifth SHOOTER in this collection and the first one that ships with a real
  ANTICHEAT. Everything below was measured through the bridge before a line of
  this was written; where a number appears in this file it came off the running
  client, not off a guess.

  ============================================================================
  THE ANTICHEAT, AND WHY THIS FILE IS SHAPED THE WAY IT IS
  ============================================================================

  `Modules.Client.Controllers.IntegrityController` was decompiled and read in
  full. It does not kick and it does not ban - it REPORTS, over
  `Remotes.Combat.SessionTelemetry:FireServer(reason, {device, locale, build})`,
  and each reason is sent exactly once per session (a dedupe table in `send`).
  What it watches, and how often:

    ENV_GLOBAL       42 executor globals looked up in getfenv(1..8)   6-12s
    FENV_SRC         debug.info(getfenv, "s") changed                 6-12s
    CANARY           a random key it planted in its own env           6-12s
    MM_INDEX         __index replaced                                 6-12s
    MM_NAMECALL      __namecall replaced                              6-12s
    MM_NOTC          either metamethod is no longer a C closure       6-12s
    FIRESERVER_HOOK  SessionTelemetry.FireServer is not a C closure   6-12s
    PCALL_HOOK       pcall no longer runs its argument                6-12s
    STACK_NAMECALL   197 nested coroutine.wrap overflows (DEX probe)  6-12s
    RECOIL_S_LOW     RecoilSpring.s < 6 on the controller or weapon   0.35s
    BODYMOVER        BodyVelocity/Gyro/Position/Thrust/AngularVelocity live
    LOG_SIG          LogService output matching a tool-name word list live

  MEASURED, and this is the fact the whole file rests on: with the bridge
  running for several minutes with `decompile`, `hookfunction` and `getgc` all
  resolvable, the dedupe table inside `send` was **EMPTY**. Potassium does not
  leak its globals into the game's environment, so `checkGlobals` never fires.
  We are clean - as long as the six rules below are kept:

    1. NOTHING here hooks a metamethod. No hookmetamethod, anywhere, ever.
    2. NOTHING here hooks FireServer.
    3. NOTHING here writes RecoilSpring. The recoil page CANCELS the residual on
       the camera instead, which is invisible to that check - and measured:
       GunController.RecoilSpring.s reads 6.3 against a threshold of 6, so it is
       not a value with room to be nudged even if we wanted to.
    4. NOTHING here parents a BodyMover to the character.
    5. NOTHING printed by this file contains a word from that log list.
    6. The panel says all of the above out loud, on its own page, so the user can
       check it rather than take it on faith.

  ============================================================================
  WHAT THE GAME LOOKS LIKE
  ============================================================================

  * **The character you can see is not the character Roblox thinks you have.**
    `Player.Character` is an R6 decoy - five parts, three of them named `Torso2`.
    The real body is `workspace.MercPlayers.MercHitboxes_<name>`, a 15-part R15
    rig, every part Transparency 1, CanQuery true, CanCollide false, collision
    group `Map`. `MercVisual_<name>` beside it is the model you see. Dead bodies
    are reparented as `MercHitboxes_<name>_Corpse`.

    This matters: the published silent-aim scripts for this game that read
    `player.Character.Head` are aiming at the decoy.

  * **...but the decoy carries the Humanoid, and that Humanoid is the health.**
    Measured over a 20s sample on a live round: `huso12sila` was caught at 13 HP
    in one frame of 125, and three players went 100 -> 0 exactly as their
    `RigState` went Alive -> Ragdolled. So health is real and replicates for
    everybody. The intermediate values are just rare, because the game is called
    TTK for a reason.

  * **Positions replicate in full, with no culling whatsoever.** Measured on five
    enemies at 120-383 studs, every one of them behind an opaque wall: exact head
    positions readable for all five.

  * **`RigState` has THREE values, not two**: Alive, Ragdolled, Dead. Ragdolled is
    a body on the floor, and it still has a full set of hitbox parts - so "the
    model exists" proves nothing and neither does "it has a Head".

  * **Teams exist even in the free-for-all.** `Hostility.TeamOf` answered `Alpha`
    for us and `Bravo` for another player in a mode whose `GameMode` attribute
    reads `FFA`, and `Hostility.IsHostile(a, b)` answered true. So this file never
    reconstructs hostility from a team name - it asks the game's own function,
    which is right in every mode by construction.

  * **THE HEAD IS WORTH EVERYTHING HERE**, which is the opposite of Deagle Arena
    and worth stating because it decides the default. Read out of
    `Registries.Weapons` against 100 max health:

        M18       37 x4 = 148      MK23     42 x4 = 168
        Rattler   34 x4 = 136      AUGA3    34 x4 = 136
        KH9       32 x4 = 128      UMP45    31 x4 = 124
        MP5A2     28 x4 = 112      M1ASOCOM 55 x2 = 110

    Every single firearm one-shots to the head. To the body the same guns need
    three hits. So `aimPart` defaults to Head, and the panel prints that table
    next to the dropdown rather than asserting it.

  * **Round state is attributes on `workspace` itself**, not a Status folder:
    `GamePhase`, `MatchState`, `GameMode`, `CurrentMapName`, `MapRoundEndsAt`,
    `ModeScoreLimit`, `DeployPolicy`, `Mode_Respawns`, plus the whole `Flow_*` set
    the outro screen runs on.

  * **The scoreboard is player attributes and it replicates for EVERYONE**:
    `Kills`, `Deaths`, `MatchXP`, `MatchIC`, `CurrentWeapon`, `SelectedSlot`,
    `Deployed`, `PlayerMode`, `InWorld`, `WeaponLaserOn`, `WeaponFlashlightOn`,
    `ThrowableAmmo_Flashbang`. `Kills` is the oracle every claim here is checked
    against, and `CurrentWeapon` means the ESP can print what each enemy holds.

  * **The clip-brush trap has a clean answer here, and the game supplies it.**
    91 `MapBarrier` parts plus `MapCeiling` are Transparency 1 and CanCollide
    true - exactly the Counter Blox brushes that made every enemy read as behind
    a wall - but they sit in collision group `Ignore`, and
    `Default x Ignore = false`. A plain default-group ray already skips them and
    no hand-built filter is needed. What DOES legitimately block is the 492
    `Collision` hulls, the 70 `shelf_hitbox` parts and corpses (`Default x Corpse
    = true`), and that is correct: the game's own `Discharge` sets no collision
    group either, so its bullet stops on exactly the same things.

  * **The client's exclude list is only the player characters.** Pulled out of
    `BulletController.Discharge`'s upvalues, `buildExcludeList` walks
    `Players:GetPlayers()` and inserts each `Character` - i.e. the R6 decoys. This
    file uses the same list plus its own POV rig, so the wall check answers the
    question the shot asks.

  * **THE CAMERA CONTROLLER IS AUTHORITATIVE. Camera writes do NOTHING here, and
    the first measurement of this said the opposite.** Worth writing down because
    the wrong test looks exactly like a right one:

        WRONG - write `want` every frame from a Camera+1 binding, then read the
        camera back and compare. It matches perfectly, because you are painting
        over the controller every single frame. This is what was measured first
        and it produced the claim "the write sticks".

        RIGHT - (a) write a small nudge each frame and compare what you LEFT
        against what the NEXT frame finds, and (b) write once, unbind, and see
        whether it survives.

    Measured properly: a 0.5 deg nudge came back **0.4977 deg** different on the
    next frame - a 100% revert, every frame, over 281 samples. A single 20 deg
    write read **19.94 deg away from the target** and **0.08 deg from where it
    started** five frames later. The controller rebuilds the CFrame from angles
    it keeps itself, exactly like BloxStrike.

    The symptom is the BloxStrike signature: the assist reports plenty of degrees
    per second of work while the view never moves, so the panel looks busy and
    nothing happens.

  * **So the view is moved with `mousemoverel`, and it persists.** Measured:
    `mousemoverel(60, 0)` turned **-2.47 deg** of yaw, `(-60, 0)` turned
    **+2.47**, `(200, 0)` turned **-8.08**, and `(0, 30)` turned **-1.05 deg** of
    pitch - about **0.041 deg per pixel**, still there a full second later.
    Positive x turns right and lowers yaw; positive y looks down. `aimPath`
    therefore defaults to Mouse; the Camera option is kept only so the difference
    can be demonstrated, and it is labelled as doing nothing.

  * **The shot state is published by the client and needs no inferring.**
    `GunController.Weapon` carries `MagAmmo`, `MaxMagSize`, `FireRate`,
    `FireMode`, `IsAiming`, `IsReloading`, `IsEquipped`, `CanFire`, `Name` and a
    live `ShotIndex`. So the spray position is READ, not counted off a fire rate
    the way counterblox had to.

  * **There are no Actor VMs.** `getactors()` returns 0, so everything is
    reachable from the main VM. Nothing in this file needs that, but it is why
    the recon above could be done at all.

  ============================================================================
  SILENT AIM - MEASURED, AND NOW SHIPPED (off by default)
  ============================================================================

  The aim assist and the trigger still touch NOTHING they should not: the aim
  moves the VIEW, the trigger presses the REAL mouse button, and neither fabricates
  a hit. But the two shots that used to be left unfired have now been fired.

  MEASURED 2026-08-31, against the `Kills` attribute and the replicated decoy
  health that is the oracle here: `BulletController._ClaimMercHit` fires
  `Remotes.Combat.MercHitClaim:FireServer(weapon, userId, partName, hitPos, origin,
  normal, fireId)`, and the server applies it with NO line-of-sight and NO
  direction re-check. One claim built on a head part 160 studs away and out of
  view took the target 100 -> 0 in a single frame and credited the kill. A second
  measurement through the shipped target-picker landed 87 damage at range (falloff,
  not a one-shot) - same conclusion: the server trusts the part the client names.

  So the SILENT page exists, and it is the one genuinely dangerous thing in this
  file. It reuses the game's own `_ClaimMercHit` (so the payload is byte-for-byte a
  real hit's), is gated to the real gun by default so ammo and fire rate move as
  normal, and is - as the genre file requires - off by default, in no preset, with
  its own written warning on the page. It is far more detectable than the aim
  assist: a body dropping to zero while you face away is obvious to the whole lobby.
  The IntegrityController does not watch it (its reasons are all hook / BodyMover
  checks), but a server-side hit-RATE check was not tested - only single claims were.

-- lasts: five failures inside a couple of seconds, and the chams were dead for
-- the rest of the session again. Reported as "in a new lobby the chams are gone
-- again".
--
-- So there is no permanent state any more. The failure reason is kept for the
-- panel to show, the retry backs off to a ten second ceiling, and it never stops

-- DEAD TIME, AND WHY THE ASSIST SHOOK.
--
-- `mousemoverel` does not move the view on the frame it is called - the game
-- consumes it on the next one. So the error measured this frame STILL CONTAINS
-- everything that was already requested last frame, and asking for it again puts
-- two or three copies of the same correction in flight. The view then sails past
-- the target, the error flips sign, and the whole thing oscillates. Reported as
-- "it jerks back and forth really hard without me doing anything".
--
-- The weapon path makes it worse, because the gun follows the camera through a
-- spring: that is a SECOND lag on top of the input one.
--
-- So: remember what has been asked for and not yet seen, subtract it from the
-- raw error, and only ask for the difference.
-- EXACTLY ONE FRAME, NOT AN ACCUMULATOR.
--
-- The first version banked every request and drew it down by however far the
-- camera was seen to move. That stalls: the observed movement carries the
-- PLAYER's mouse as well as ours, the pixel conversion is only an estimate, and
-- anything the game did not deliver stayed on the books forever - so the
-- correction was permanently reduced by a debt that could never be repaid, and
-- the aim sat several degrees off the target without ever closing.
--
-- What is actually in flight is one frame's request, because that is when
-- mousemoverel lands. Remembering just that is enough to stop the double-request
-- oscillation and cannot deadlock.

-- recoil: measured, then cancelled ON THE CAMERA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- READ THE ANTICHEAT BLOCK AT THE TOP BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING HERE.
--
-- The obvious no-recoil for this game is `RecoilSpring.s`, and it is exactly what
-- `IntegrityController.checkRecoilSpring` samples every 0.35 seconds, on both the
-- controller and the weapon, reporting anything below 6. Measured live:
-- GunController.RecoilSpring.s is 6.3 and the equipped weapon's is 18. So the
-- controller value sits 0.3 above the threshold - there is not even room to nudge
-- it, and this file never writes either one.
--
-- What it does instead is the counterblox method, which that check cannot see
-- because it touches nothing the game owns:
--
--   * every frame, compare the camera's pitch/yaw change against the raw mouse
--     movement UserInputService reported for that same frame
--   * WHILE NOT FIRING, the ratio of the two IS the effective sensitivity -
--     averaged continuously, and only on frames the script did not write the
--     camera itself
--   * WHILE FIRING, whatever change is left after subtracting sensitivity x mouse
--     delta is not the player. That residual is the recoil, and a configurable
--     share of it is subtracted back off the camera.
--
-- It needs no calibration step, it adapts if the player changes their sensitivity
-- mid-game, and both numbers are on the panel so the whole thing can be checked
-- rather than believed.

-- THE GAME'S OWN RECOIL, REPRODUCED FROM ITS OWN SOURCE.
--
-- FPSController, in the same Fired handler that sends the shot:
--
--   scale      = CameraRecoilMult * aimScale * GetAttachmentRecoilMult()
--   aimScale   = CameraRecoilAimMult == 1 and 1
--                or 1 + AimAmount * (CameraRecoilAimMult - 1)
--   ramp       = clamp((ShotIndex - 1) / 8, 0, 1) * 0.85 + 0.45
--   vertical   = 1.55 * RecoilPitchMult * scale * ramp
--   horizontal = (random() - 0.5)
--                * (0.85 * (1 + bloom * 2 * (1 + AimAmount * 1.5)))
--                * scale * RecoilYawMult
--
-- So the VERTICAL kick is fully deterministic - weapon constants, the shot index
-- and how far you are aimed in, nothing else - and can be cancelled before it is
-- even measured. The HORIZONTAL one is a fresh `math.random()` per shot and is
-- therefore NOT predictable at all; only its envelope is. Anything claiming to
-- pre-empt horizontal recoil in this game is guessing.
--
-- What one of these units is worth in camera degrees is NOT documented, so it is
-- not hard-coded: the ratio of the measured pitch residual to the predicted
-- vertical is learned while firing and shown on the panel, exactly the way
-- BloxStrike's pattern scale was.
