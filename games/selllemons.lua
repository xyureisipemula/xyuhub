--
-- A classic conveyor tycoon: 453 purchase buttons across thirteen areas, eight
-- income streams sitting on top of them, and a Rebirth -> Evolve -> Ascend
-- prestige ladder. Everything below was measured against the server through the
-- game's own client component API, which is the state oracle here:
--
--   local T  = require(ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Tycoon.Tycoon)
--   local lt = T.getLocal()
--   lt:GetComponent(require(ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Tycoon.Component.<X>))
--
-- and it is complete: TycoonBalances (cash, cashSpent, investors, tokens),
-- TycoonAnalyzer (all 453 purchases and all 8 earners, keyed by id, each with a
-- live .Instance), TycoonIncome, TycoonUpgrades, TycoonPowers, TycoonRebirth,
-- TycoonEvolution, TycoonAscension, TycoonPhoneOffers, TycoonCompanions.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- EVERY NUMBER IN THIS GAME IS A log10 FLOAT
-- ============================================================================
-- ReplicatedStorage.Modules.Huge is the game's own big-number library and every
-- currency, price, interval, income value and investor count is stored as its
-- base-10 logarithm. H.zero is -inf and H.one is 0, so a balance of $1 is the
-- number 0 and an empty balance is -inf. Verified:
--     H.toNumber(1.1760912590556813) = 15.0      H.formatTime(...)   = "15s"
--     H.formatAbbreviated(50.50261505280331)     = "318Qnd"
-- Never hand-roll a suffix table and never compare a Huge against a plain
-- number. H.formatAbbreviated is what the panel prints.
--
-- TRAP: the attribute and the component disagree. Values.Values carries
-- Investors = "0" as a STRING while TycoonBalances:GetInvestors() returns -inf.
-- The component is authoritative; the attributes are not.
--
-- TRAP: a purchase model's Name is not its Balance key. The model is called
-- "Lemon Stand", the id in Balance.PurchaseOrder / PurchasePrices is
-- "LemonStand". Only TycoonAnalyzer:GetPurchases() knows the mapping, so this
-- file never derives an id from a name.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- MEASURED, ALL OF IT, WITH THE AUTOMATION OFF
-- ============================================================================
--
--  * THE TYCOON ITSELF HAS NO PROXIMITY CHECK ANYWHERE. A purchase fired from
--    578 studs above the plot went through at the exact quoted price (cash $14
--    -> $8 for the $6 Juicer, Purchased flipped true). Waking a stream from 576
--    studs paid identically to waking it from 9 studs: +$76.28 in the same 10s
--    window, both times. Buying, upgrading, waking, the minigames, the drops
--    and the phone offers all work with the body parked wherever it stands.
--
--  * FRUIT IS THE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS ALSO THE BIGGEST EARNER IN THE GAME.
--    Five clicks on map fruit from 204 studs paid exactly 0. The same five from
--    6.2 studs paid twice. The ClickDetector's MaxActivationDistance is 16 and
--    the server honours it, so this is the one thing here that needs the body
--    moved - which is why harvestFruit() teleports and everything else does not.
--    Worth it: a 25-fruit teleport sweep took 6.6s, 9 of the 25 paid, and the
--    total was $3.21 QUADRILLION - about $483 trillion a second, against roughly
--    $25 billion a second from the trade minigame at the same moment.
--
--  * KLICKEN is earner:WakeAsync() -> TycoonIncome:WakeManualStreamAsync(name).
--    A stream with Automatic = false pays nothing on its own, so early on this
--    is the entire income. Payouts are server rate limited and SUBLINEAR in the
--    number of calls - 6s windows, same stream, $3.81 a payout:
--        0.5s spacing / 12 calls -> 6 payouts      0.1s  /  60 -> 9
--        0.3s spacing / 20 calls -> 7 payouts      0.05s / 120 -> 13
--        0.2s spacing / 30 calls -> 7 payouts
--    A separate 10s window at 0.5s spacing paid 20 times for 20 calls, which
--    only fits a token bucket: full after an idle stretch, burstable once, then
--    refilling at roughly the stream interval. Hammering it is therefore mostly
--    wasted, which is why the default spacing is 0.15s and not 0.
--
--  * VERBESSERN is earner:UpgradeAsync(n) -> the earner's Upgrade
--    RemoteFunction. UpgradeAsync(1) took LemonStand level 1 -> 2, charged
--    exactly the quoted $7.65 and moved the stream value $3.81 -> $5.84.
--    UpgradeAsync(10) DID NOTHING AT ALL - level, cash and stream value all
--    unchanged. The server silently drops any n above Count, and Count comes
--    from GetNextUpgradeInfo() and is driven by the UpgradeStack power (1 while
--    that power is unowned, then 5 / 25 / 100 / inf).
--    Both published scripts get this wrong: one doubles n (1, 2, 4, 8 ...) and
--    the other loops i = 1..10. Only the n = 1 call ever lands, and because the
--    remote answers without erroring their pcall still reports success.
--
--  * THE POWERS ARE PRICED IN INVESTORS, NOT CASH. Attempting Manage with $647
--    in the bank and zero investors answered, verbatim:
--        ServerTycoonPowers:130: insufficient investors
--    Tokens (25 on a fresh save) are not the powers currency either. Investors
--    come out of Rebirth, so Rebirth gates the powers and the powers gate
--    everything else. Investors are CONSUMED, not just required - buying one
--    took the balance 176 -> 76. Config.Powers prices, in investors:
--        Manage           100                     (no Bonuses table)
--        ClickFruitValue  250 / 1e6 / 1e18        Amt 2/4/6, Mult 2/4/8
--        WalkSpeed        400 / 1e9 / 1e27 / 1e72 1.5 / 2 / 3 / 4
--        UpgradeStack     1e3 / 1e12 / 1e33 / 1e63  Count 5 / 25 / 100 / inf
--        BuyNext          1e38 / 1e67 / 1e93      150 / 250 / inf
--        AutoFruit        1e42
--    Each one also carries a DevProductID, which is the Robux shortcut. This
--    file only ever spends investors.
--
--  * MANAGE IS 100 INVESTORS FOR A HUD TAB. It was bought to find out: level
--    0 -> 1, investors 176 -> 76, and nothing else moved - no stream turned
--    automatic, the upgrade Count stayed 1, income was unchanged. A getgc sweep
--    for the string finds it referenced only by UI.Layers.Manage.UIManageMenu
--    and the orchard billboard. It is a menu unlock, so this file skips it.
--
--  * REBIRTH, MEASURED END TO END. 93 buttons and $558Qn with 175 potential
--    investors went to 3 buttons, $31 and 176 investors, rebirths 0 -> 1. It
--    wipes the purchases and the balance and pays out the potential in full.
--
--  * THE TRADE MINIGAME IS THE BIGGEST LEVER IN THE GAME.
--    MinigameTradeService.Start returns {MaxEarnings, StartingCash, LineConfig}
--    where MaxEarnings is the server's own statement of a perfect run. Passing
--    that number straight back to .End paid +$7,548,571,798 in one call (cash
--    $368M -> $7.92B). 300s cooldown. This script submits the announced
--    MaxEarnings and nothing above it - that is playing the round perfectly,
--    not inventing a result.
--
--  * THE RACE MINIGAME PAYS ON A CLIENT-SUPPLIED PLACEMENT.
--    Config.MinigameRacePlacementCash = {[1] = 1, [2] = 0.5, [3] = 0.25,
--    [4] = 0}. Start returns the full prize up front, End(n) pays prize *
--    factor[n]. End(1) paid the announced $229 in full ($8 -> $237). 300s.
--
--  * CASH DROPS ARE REDEEMED BY ID AND TOUCHING THEM DOES NOTHING.
--    RemoteSignal "DropService.New" fires (id, kind, lifetime) - measured
--    ("994", "Cash", 1200). RemoteRequest "DropService.Redeem":InvokeServer(id)
--    answered 12.798968597564983, which is $6.3 TRILLION. Dragging the body
--    through the CashDrop part in workspace.Drops left it sitting there.
--    NOTE: the most-viewed published script listens on "CashDropService.New"
--    and "CashDropService.Redeem", neither of which exists in this place. Its
--    drop collector is dead code.
--
--  * PHONE OFFERS CAN BE HAGGLED, AND HAGGLING TOO HARD LOSES THEM.
--    The offer arrives on the tycoon's PhoneOffer RemoteEvent as a Huge number.
--    PhoneOffers:RaiseOffer() raised one from $12.336B -> $17.275B (+40%) and
--    then -> $19.088B (+10%). The THIRD raise returned the offer as nil - the
--    deal was gone. Measured once, so it is probably a per-raise roll; the
--    default here is one raise and the stepper stops at two.
--
--  * A FRUIT IS RIPE EXACTLY WHEN IT STILL HAS ITS ClickFruitPart.
--    Around 820 parts carry the ClickFruit tag across the whole map. A ripe one
--    is Transparency 0 and owns Fruit.ClickFruitPart.ClickDetector; a harvested
--    one is Transparency 1 and the ClickFruitPart is gone entirely, so the
--    presence of that child IS the ripeness test and nothing else has to be
--    read. They regrow on their own.
--    That test is what fixed the first version of this file: it filtered to the
--    player's own tycoon, and after one sweep all 36 fruits there were
--    transparent and detector-less while 448 ripe ones stood on the map trees
--    being ignored. Own plot, map trees and other players' plots all pay - the
--    only thing that matters is the detector and standing next to it.
--
--  * SpecialIncome IS THE PAYOUT ORACLE. The tycoon's SpecialIncome RemoteEvent
--    fires (sourceName, hugeAmount) for every one-off payout - "ClickFruit",
--    "MinigameRace" and so on. That is how this file reports what each feature
--    actually earned instead of guessing from the balance.
--
--  * THE PRESTIGE FORMULAS, read off the components:
--      GetPotentialInvestors = investors + cashToNewInvestors(cash + cashSpent)
--        with Balance.RebirthParameters.Investors = {1.8e17, 0.44}. Spending is
--        therefore never a loss - cashSpent counts towards the next rebirth
--        exactly as unspent cash does, which is why this file spends freely.
--      GetEvolutionProgress = (investors + investorsSpent + potential)
--                             / nextEvolutionInvestors(evolution), evolve at 1.
--      GetAscensionProgress = purchasedCount / 453, ascend at 1.
--      Rebirth / Evolve / Ascend all take NO arguments.
--      Config: EvolutionMultiplier 42, AscensionMultiplier 7.77,
--              AscensionPenalty 3.33, BaseInvestorBonus 0.01.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- NEVER TOUCHED
-- ============================================================================
--  * Purchase:InvokeServer(true) - the "forever purchase". Config.Products
--    lists PermanentPurchase with DevProductID 3558362570, so the published
--    scripts' "Use Forever Purchase" option is a Robux prompt. This file always
--    calls TryPurchaseAsync(), which sends no argument.
--  * earner:PromptBoostAsync() / GetBoostProductName() - EarnerBoost1..8, Robux.
--  * UseTimeCash / UseEarnerBoost / DoubleOfflineCash / FreeRebirth /
--    FreeEvolve / InvestorBoost / RateBoost - every one of them is a DevProduct.
--  * VideoAdService.ShowAd - free, but it plays a real rewarded video at the
--    player. Left out rather than made a surprise.
--  * Core.AdminService.RunCommandRemote - present, never fired.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- UNVERIFIED, AND SAID SO IN THE PANEL
-- ============================================================================
-- The whole Orchard subsystem is gated behind Config.Orchard.UnlockCashPrice =
-- 1e25 and the test account never got within twelve orders of magnitude of it,
-- so none of the orchard code below has ever been executed against a live
-- server. It is written from the module API (OrchardPlot.States = Empty 0,
-- TreeGrowing 1, FruitGrowing 2, FruitReady 3; RemoteRequest OrchardPlot.Plant
-- / .Harvest / .GetFruit / .UseItem / .SellUpgrade / .DestroyTree; the tycoon's
-- UnlockOrchard / UnlockPlot / SellFruits / EatFruit remotes) and it ships OFF.
-- Treat anything it reports as a claim, not a measurement.

--   ClickFruitValue  FIRST, at 250. Its bonuses are {Amt 2, Mult 2} rising to
--                    {6, 8}, so level one alone is two fruit per click at
--                    double value - four times the income of the single
--                    biggest earner in the game, for a quarter of what the
--                    next power costs.
--   UpgradeStack     second, at 1,000. The only thing that lifts Count, and
--                    Count is how many earner levels one call may buy
--                    (1 -> 5 -> 25 -> 100 -> inf).
--   BuyNext          1e38 investors, and AutoFruit 1e42. Both far future, both
--                    worth taking the moment they are reachable.
--
-- SKIPPED ON PURPOSE, and both were paid for to find out:
--   Manage    100 investors, and it buys a HUD TAB. The only things that
--             reference the power are UI.Layers.Manage.UIManageMenu and the
--             orchard billboard. Bought it: investors 176 -> 76, level 0 -> 1,
--             and nothing moved - no stream became automatic, the upgrade
--             Count stayed at 1, income was unchanged. Useless to a script
--             that never opens the menu.
--   WalkSpeed 400 investors for 1.5x to 4x movement. This file teleports; it
--             never walks anywhere.
-- Both stay in SKIP_POWERS rather than being deleted, so the panel can offer
