    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Despite the name this is not a quiz game. It is a carry-and-place plot
    income game with a logo-quiz door between the stages, and the doors are
    irrelevant because the whole route is flown over them.

    The loop, as measured through the bridge on 2026-08-20:

      pick the richest brainrot lying in the world (all 110 are visible from
      home, they are NOT streamed out)
        -> fly to it, pin the root part on it ~1.2s, fireproximityprompt(Grab)
        -> plr:GetAttribute("Carrying") goes true, CarryingObject points at it
        -> fly home AT y = 300 and land on the plot; arriving on your own plot
           is the whole delivery, the server fires BrainrotSaved
        -> PlaceBrainrotOnStand:FireServer(standModel, toolName)
        -> CollectStandCash:FireServer("<n>") from anywhere

    Verified facts this script is built on (do not re-derive):

      * There is NO stage gate. A stage 10 brainrot was grabbed at rebirth 0
        with 2,490$ to the player's name. The MathDoors only gate the walking
        route, and every option part carries a readable IsCorrect attribute
        anyway.
      * Free CFrame teleporting works, no snapback, no reporting remote seen.
      * THE GROUND ROUTE HOME DROPS THE CARRY. Walking/warping back along the
        ground lost the brainrot every time at x ~ 2100. Crossing at y = 300
        carried a 2.92B/s Secret all the way from x 2657 to the plot. The
        cruise altitude is not decoration, it is the delivery.
      * CollectStandCash is NOT position gated - 26,231,128 collected from
        2,347 studs away.
      * Placement needs the brainrot EQUIPPED as a Tool. A freshly delivered
        one is equipped by the server; one pulled back off a stand only lands
        in Data.BrainrotsBackpack plus a Tool in the Backpack, and
        Humanoid:EquipTool(tool) is the missing step. Firing the place remote
        with the inventory key while nothing is held does nothing at all.
      * Income of a placed brainrot = brainrot_level_upgrade.GetIncome(
        CashPerSecond, Level) = cps * 1.0806976^(Level-1). The CashPerSecond
        stored on the model already includes the mutation multiplier, so it is
        the raw figure and comparable across brainrots. plr PerSecond is the
        sum of those TIMES the rebirth multiplier - never mix the two.
      * Level price = cps/5 * 1.17^(Level-1). Verified to the unit: predicted
        374,730, charged 374,730, income +226,798/s. Payback at level 1 is
        ~1.65s and only reaches ~126s around level 50. It is by far the
        strongest sink in the game.
      * REBIRTH WIPES THE WHOLE BALANCE, not just its price: 326,019,684 -> 0.
        It multiplies money by 1 + 0.5*rebirths and resets speed (30 -> 18), but
        it KEEPS every placed brainrot - measured on a full plot, rebirth 2 -> 3,
        all 21 seats byte-identical before and after and PerSecond 246.06B ->
        307.57B, exactly x1.25. The balance regenerates in about two minutes at
        that income, so it is on by default; the money is spent down into levels
        and base upgrades first because those survive the reset.
      * leaderstats.Money is a StringValue ("2,490$") for display. The real
        numbers all live in plr.Data (Money, Rebirth, StandsUnlocked, Stands,
        StandsCash, BrainrotsBackpack).
      * Stands above Data.StandsUnlocked have no prompt and the server refuses
        them, and UnlockStand is a server -> client NOTIFICATION - firing it
        upward in three argument shapes changed nothing. What widens the plot is
        the "Upgrade Base" screen standing on the plot (Plots.<n>.Upgrader), a
        plain ClickDetector at 32 studs: it reads "15 >> 16 / 100.0T $" and each
        base level is one more stand, so StandsUnlocked = 8 + base level and
        level 16 is the ceiling at 24 stands. The price is
        Modules.unlock_stands[nextLevel] (2.5M, 5M, 17.5M, 115M ... 100T) - take
        it from there, never from the abbreviated label. Verified end to end:
        saved to 103.57T, bought base level 16, 24 stands, then rebirthed.
      * LEVELS STOP AT 100. level_upgrades_manager greys the button out and
        answers "Max level reached!". Once the plot is maxed the base upgrade is
        the only sink left, which is why it gets a reserve instead of being
        outbid by levels forever.
