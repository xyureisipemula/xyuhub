    aimclick.lua - "[W3] +1 Aim Per Click"  (place 70990741130622, Dxr Studio)

    Verified against server-side values on 2026-09-22, account notpolpne.

    The loop the game wants:  shoot -> Aim,  Aim is the damage that breaks a
    wall,  a broken wall drops an item,  items sell for Money,  Money buys guns
    (and a gun's Aim figure IS the per-click value),  rebirth multiplies
    everything and respawns every wall.

    Everything below was READ out of the game's own client scripts (decompile
    works on all 42 of them, there are no Actor VMs) and then MEASURED against
    the server.  Nothing here was guessed.

    * GunFire:FireServer(lookVector, true) is the whole engine.  AimClient does
      exactly this on a mouse click and nothing else; the "AimClick" RemoteEvent
      that the name suggests is referenced by no client script at all.
      THE SERVER CREDITS EXACTLY 13 CALLS A SECOND.  Measured four ways in one
      window: 10/s -> 43 of 43 credited, 15.2/s -> 12.8/s, 31.8/s -> 13/s, one
      per frame (33.75/s) -> 13/s.  Firing faster than ~13/s is pure waste, so
      clickGap sits just inside it.  A control band that fired nothing gained
      exactly 0 - nothing accrues on its own.
    * Per click = the equipped gun's Aim x rebirth x index x aura x streak x
      friends x the server boost.  Pan measured at exactly 4.0/click.  The gun
      is therefore the single biggest lever in the game: Can 1, Pan 4, Revolver
      18 ... Gun22 7.3M ... Ragnarok 2.2e15.
    * The SHOOTING ZONES multiply it, and only while the body is inside one.
      Measured in the x1.5 zone: 5.64 per click against 4.00 at the base.  The
      free ones are gated purely on the rebirth count (x1.5 at 0, x2 at 2, x4
      at 5, x6 at 7, x8 at 10, x10 at 13, x13 at 16, x16 at 20).  x20 / x35 /
      x100 / x250 / x1000 carry a GamepassId - filter on THE FIELD, never on the
      name, and never touch them.
    * WALLS: damage per tick is the current AIM BALANCE, and Aim is NOT spent -
      it kept climbing at the full base rate the whole time a wall was being
      broken.  Overkill does not cascade: a 4,460 HP wall took 3,816 and then
      644, the remaining 3,172 of the second tick was thrown away.
    * THE WALL GATE IS WRITTEN OUT IN THE CLIENT:  WallClient's own warning
      reads "Grow to <maxHp/120> Aim to break it in time!" - a wall that is not
      finished inside its window heals back to full.  So a wall is reachable
      exactly when  aim >= MaxHealth / 120,  and no damage curve has to be
      derived.  Walls are NOT a chain: standing at wall 15 broke 14, 15, 16 and
      17 while 4-13 were still standing, so the target is simply the DEEPEST
      reachable one.
    * The equipped tool breaks walls BY ITSELF.  A control window that fired no
      remote at all, with the body merely pinned next to a wall, still broke it
      and still credited aim.  GunClient (inside the Tool) runs its own Heartbeat
      loop that aims at FindZoneAt() or else NearestWallTarget(pos, 30) and calls
      the very same GunFire remote, rate limited to 1 / FireRate.
    * SO THE TWO HALVES HAVE DIFFERENT CEILINGS, and this is the thing that made
      the first build useless:  AIM is credited 13 times a second, but WALL
      DAMAGE lands at the gun's FireRate, which is 2 on every gun in the game.
      Measured on a 1.43M wall: 14 damage ticks in 8s, ~21,000 each (exactly the
      aim balance), so 1.75 hits/s.  A wall therefore takes
          maxHp / (aim * 2)  seconds,
      and the first build sat on each wall for a flat 6s, left before anything
      fell, and the wall healed back to full - which is precisely what the panel
      was reporting ("The wall healed! Grow to ... Aim").  The target has to be
      the deepest wall that falls inside a TIME budget, not the deepest one the
      /120 rule calls reachable.
    * THE WALLS DROP THEIR LOOT ON THE FLOOR, and collecting it is the entire
      economy.  Broken walls spawn Models into workspace.SpawnedItems carrying
      ItemId / SourceZoneId, each with a PromptAnchor holding a "Pick up"
      ProximityPrompt (range 10, hold 0.35).  204 of them were lying around
      untouched while the first build farmed - one single "Toilet" sold for
      84,745 against a whole balance of 220, and the deep zones carry items
      worth 700K-800K of config Value before the cash multipliers.
    * MOST OF THE FLOOR IS GHOSTS, and this cost more time than everything else
      in this file put together.  workspace.SpawnedItems held a steady 204
      models, and the great majority of them are dead client replicas the server
      no longer has - already taken by somebody else, never cleaned up locally.
      They are indistinguishable from live loot: correct ItemId, live anchor,
      working prompt, PromptTriggered fires, and the server then says nothing.
      Because the picker ranks by value it kept handing back the SAME high value
      ghost ("Rocket ship", "Fish", "Coal") forever, and so did every hand
      written probe, which is why it looked like a global account lock that a
      rejoin had cured.  It was not: right after the rejoin the nearest item
      happened to be live.  Proof, once the refused id was excluded by hand:
      three pickups in a row, bag 5 -> 8 of 9.  ONE failure therefore strikes a
      model off permanently, and a miss is never treated as a lock.
    * The hold has to clear HoldDuration by a WIDE margin.  At HoldDuration +
      0.25s the prompt fired PromptButtonHoldBegan and PromptButtonHoldEnded
      with no PromptTriggered between them - the release beat the timer - and
      that is indistinguishable from a server refusal from the outside.  The
      event trace is the only thing that separates the two, so check it before
      concluding anything about a prompt: no Triggered means the INPUT was
      wrong, Triggered with no effect means the SERVER refused.
    * fireproximityprompt DOES NOT WORK IN THIS GAME - not on the item prompts
      and not on the shop NPCs either.  The prompts are Style = Custom and the
      handler is server side, so there is no client connection to fire and the
      executor's helper lands nowhere: three techniques (plain fire, zeroed
      HoldDuration, InputHoldBegin/End) all left the item on the floor from a
      measured distance of ZERO.  What works is the REAL key:
          VirtualInputManager:SendKeyEvent(true,  Enum.KeyCode.E, false, game)
          task.wait(> HoldDuration)
          VirtualInputManager:SendKeyEvent(false, Enum.KeyCode.E, false, game)
      with the body pinned next to the anchor until ProximityPromptService fires
      PromptShown.  That picked the item up on the first attempt.
    * SellRequest:InvokeServer(nil) sells the whole bag and is NOT position
      gated - 170 -> 870 for one item, fired from the wall corridor.  Passing an
      item name sells that one item.  The bag is the attribute InventoryItems (a
      comma separated string) against InventorySlots.
    * BUT A FIELD SALE SILENTLY LOCKS EVERY LATER PICKUP.  The money arrives in
      full and the bag string empties, and from then on the prompt triggers,
      the server answers nothing at all, and the item stays on the floor -
      measured across five value / rarity / zone buckets and sixteen seconds of
      repeated presses at distance 0, with no message on the Notify channel.
      This is the Cut Grass bag-LOAD trap again: the carried load only clears
      at the base.  BaseReturn:FireServer() is the game's own home button, it
      flips the OutsideBase attribute to false, and the very next pickup
      succeeded.  Every sale here is therefore followed by a trip home.
    * ShopRequest:InvokeServer("buy", key) -> (true, "Purchased") and it is NOT
      a rung-by-rung ladder: the Revolver (Order 4) was bought directly with
      Order 3 still unowned.  A bought gun equips itself.
    * RequestRebirth:InvokeServer() costs Aim and Level (3,852 -> 0, level 24 ->
      1) and keeps Money, every gun, the equipped gun and the index.  It grants
      +0.5 aim multiplier and +0.2 cash multiplier per rebirth, and - measured -
      IT RESPAWNS EVERY WALL, which is what makes the farm sustainable at all.
      The gate is the level: RebirthConfig.RequiredLevel(r) = 10 * r.

    There is no anti-cheat in this game.  A string sweep for Anti / Detect /
    Kick over 5,200 live functions returned nothing of the kind - the single
    "detects hooked remotes" hit belongs to bridge.lua's own spy, not to the
    place.

    Never touched:  UpgradeSkipRequest (the Robux skip), the Sell2x product
    3708681999, every gun carrying RobuxOnly / ProductId / RequiresGodmode
    (LavaSniper, Hellbreaker, Ragnarok), every aura without a numeric Price
    (the Admin aura is gamepass-only) or carrying RequiresGodmode, the five
    gamepass shooting zones, and the AutoClick gamepass 1951862607.
