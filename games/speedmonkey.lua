--
-- The whole game in one sentence: you run, every 0.25s of running grants XP
-- multiplied by your equipped upgrade, XP makes levels, levels make rebirths,
-- rebirths unlock worlds, and touching a stage's win plate pays wins - which is
-- the requirement (never the cost) of the next upgrade.
--
-- Everything below was measured against the server through Player.Data, which is
-- the state oracle in this game: Level, Xp, Wins, Rebirths, World, Charms and the
-- charm shop all live there as real ValueBase objects that the server writes.
--
-- Measured, all of it, with the automation off:
--   * NormalWin.Button carries a TouchInterest. Pinning the HumanoidRootPart on
--     it pays. World1 Stage1 = +1, Stage3 = +20, Stage9 = +200K, and the payout
--     is that figure times the win multiplier (measured x2 here, so +400,000).
--   * THE PLATE NOW HAS A ~13 SECOND PER-PLAYER COOLDOWN, re-measured 2026-08-20.
--     It used to pay every ~1.1s and that number is dead. Four independent runs
--     with the automation off gave gaps of 13.23 / 13.07 / 12.77 / 13.09s, so the
--     cadence is 13.0s +-0.3 and nothing shortens it:
--       - movement makes no difference (hum:Move on and off both gave 13.1s),
--       - separating the parts every 4 frames makes no difference,
--       - leaving to Checkpoint8 and coming back makes no difference,
--       - firetouchinterest credits exactly NOTHING (the server validates the
--         touch), so it cannot be driven faster than the body can be there,
--       - the pin height does not matter: +0 and +4 studs both pay at 13.1s.
--     So World1 Stage9 is 400,000 / 13.0s = ~30.8K wins/s, against the ~180K/s
--     this file used to measure. The lever is no longer the cadence, it is the
--     plate's VALUE - World2 Stage9 pays 1e12 per touch, five million times more.
--   * WORLD1 HAS EXACTLY ONE WIN PLATE, in Stages.Stage9, and that is a change
--     too. Config.Main.StageWins still lists a value for all nine stages, but a
--     scan after streaming every checkpoint in found one NormalWin in the whole
--     world. Do not aim at Stage1-8, there is nothing there to touch.
--   * The plate is NOT gated by level or by wins. It IS gated by world:
--     World2's +1T plate credited exactly 0 while Data.World was 1.
--   * XP is +1 * upgradeMulti every 0.25s while the humanoid is moving.
--     Sampled at multi 1: one award every 0.25s, dead on.
--   * Pinning and moving at the same time works. hum:Move() every Heartbeat while
--     the CFrame is held on the plate credited BOTH: +1.8M wins and level 23 -> 33
--     in the same 10 seconds. That is why there is one loop here, not two phases.
--   * SelectUpgrade(n) works from anywhere, spends nothing, and the unlock is
--     permanent (Data.UnlockedUpgrades gains the entry). Wins are a threshold.
--   * Rebirth() resets Level and Xp to 0 and keeps wins, upgrades and selection.
--   * BuyCharm takes ONE argument, the shop SLOT (1-3), not a world name - the
--     game's own shop panel fires BuyCharm:FireServer(slot). It charges the
--     charm's wins price, verified by the balance moving.
--   * EquipBestCharms WANTS THE TYPE: "Speed" or "Wins". Fired bare it does
--     nothing whatsoever - measured 2026-08-20, eleven owned charms and not one
--     slot moved. See equipCharms().
--   * CollectShard(1..9) is FREE and NOT position gated - all nine Sunken Shards
--     were banked from the World2 spawn, ~2,500 studs away. One time only.
--
-- Never touched, all Robux: the Golden/Diamond/Galaxy/Void/Celestial treadmills,
-- every Aura and every Trail (the whole lists are DevProducts), Speed Multi,
-- Server Speed, Skip Rebirth, Skip Stages, Teleport, Revive, Skull Chest, x2 Wins
-- and the charm-rarity rolls. The panel cannot reach any of them.
