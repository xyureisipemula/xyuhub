    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A case-opening gacha bolted onto a plot income game. Buy a case, open it,
    get a gun, seat the gun on one of your tycoon slots, and it shoots the
    walls in front of it for money. Money buys more cases and gun levels;
    rebirths buy slots and unlock the better cases.

    The whole loop, measured through the bridge on 2026-08-25:

        RequestCollectMoney("Slot_N")  -> bank that slot's pad
        RequestBuyCase(<case>)         -> OwnedCases[<case>] + 1
        RequestOpenCase(<case>)        -> returns the GUN NAME, +1 OwnedGuns
        RequestEquipBest()             -> the server seats and ranks them itself
        RequestUpgradeGun(<uuid>)      -> +1 level on that gun
        RequestApplySkinMachine(uuid, "Machine_N") / RequestCollectGunSkinMachine
        RequestPlayerUpgrade("Money"|"Damage")     -> ruby, +10% income each
        RequestAutoSell(rarity)        -> toggle; the RETURN is the new state
        RequestRebirth()               -> +50% money, +1 slot, a case unlock

    Verified facts this script is built on (do not re-derive):

      * *** RequestClaimForeverGift HAS NO OnServerInvoke AND HANGS FOREVER.
        Every RemoteFunction here goes through rf(), which invokes inside a
        task.spawn behind a wall clock cap. Without that a single call parks
        the caller for good - in the bridge that means the poll loop dies and
        only a manual re-inject brings it back. It is also on a hard blocklist
        below and is never called at all.
      * Functions.GetData:InvokeServer() is the state oracle and answers in
        ~0.25s: Money, Ruby, Spins, RebirthLevel, Tycoon (per slot Owned /
        Gun uuid / MoneyGained), OwnedGuns (uuid -> Name, Rarity, Level,
        Mutations, Skins, Float, Serial), Upgrades, Totals, Rewards, Battles.
        The game's own DataController already calls it once a second, so our
        calls are ordinary traffic. It is cached here for CONFIG.dataTtl.
      * COLLECTING IS NOT POSITION GATED. RequestCollectMoney("Slot_1") banked
        $15,084 with the character never moving. The argument is the slot NAME
        as a string; passing the slot Instance returns false.
      * GUN UPGRADE COST GROWS x1.3 PER LEVEL AND INCOME ONLY x1.033.
        Measured on one USP: levels 12->13->14->15->16 cost 3937, 5118, 6654,
        8650, 11245 (exactly x1.3), and the slot's measured rate went
        607.18/s at level 12 -> 693.61/s at 16 -> 961.39/s at 26. That is
        +3.3% income per level against +30% price, so PAYBACK MULTIPLIES BY
        ~1.26 EVERY LEVEL: 140s for levels 12-16, already 888s for 16-26.
        Upgrading past ~level 20 is a money hole - the money belongs in cases,
        where a better gun's base income is 10-100x higher. Hence maxPayback.
      * INCOME IS WALL THROUGHPUT, NOT A FLAT Money_Per_Sec. Two identical
        USP r1 level 1 measured 138.2/s and 52.3/s in different slots
        (Chromatic x3 vs Frozen x1.5 mutation, plus the slot's own state).
        Ranking guns by hand is therefore guesswork - RequestEquipBest() is
        the server's own ranking and it seats them for you. Measured: it went
        from 2 filled slots to 4 in one call.
      * THE RATE LABEL LIES. Utilities.PlayerInfo.RateLabel read "$145/s"
        immediately after a reshuffle when the real measured rate was 364/s,
        and "$401/s" a moment before. Every number this script trusts comes
        from GetData MoneyGained deltas, never from a label.
      * FindFirstChild(name, true) ON A SLOT IS USELESS. A slot holds dozens
        of same-named labels at different depths, so a deep search returns a
        different one each call and the readings contradict each other. The
        exact paths are:
            Slot_N.UpgradeBoard.SurfaceGui.UpgradeButton.Holder.AmountLabel
            Slot_N.UpgradeBoard.SurfaceGui.UpgradeButton.Holder.LevelLabel
            Slot_N.GunPlatform.GunBillboard.Container.InfoHolder.MoneyLabel
      * CASES HAVE LIMITED STOCK. GetStockInfo() answers a per-case count
        (Bronze 831, Gold 24, Amethyst 3, everything above Virtuoso 0) and it
        refills on StockInterval. Buying a case with 0 stock is refused, so
        the picker filters on it. RequestRestock is a Robux product and is
        never touched.
      * CASE ACCESS IS GATED ON REBIRTH LEVEL. RebirthData.CaseUnlocks:
        Diamond 1, Ruby 2, Steadfast 3 ... Nexshard 42.
      * EV PER DOLLAR FALLS MONOTONICALLY WITH CASE PRICE - Bronze pays 0.241
        expected Money_Per_Sec per dollar, Nexshard 1.67e-11. That does NOT
        make Bronze the right buy: slots are the scarce thing, and a case is
        only worth opening if it can beat the WORST GUN ALREADY SEATED.
        Bronze is 75% rarity 1 and becomes worthless the moment the plot is
        half decent. So the picker buys the most expensive case it can afford
        whose expected value still beats the weakest slot, and otherwise
        SAVES - see the starvation note below.
      * RequestAutoSell(rarity) IS A TOGGLE WHOSE RETURN VALUE IS THE NEW
        STATE, and GetData().AutoSell DOES NOT REFLECT IT. Four toggles in
        both directions all left the field reading {5=true} while the return
        alternated true/false. Anything that wants to know the state has to
        drive it through the return value, which is what syncAutoSell does.
        It is OFF by default: whether the server refuses to auto-sell a gun
        that is currently seated on a slot was never verified, and being
        wrong there sells the plot.
      * Player upgrades (DamageLevel / MoneyLevel / MutationLevel /
        MaxStorageLevel) cost RUBY, not money - the UI code reads RubyHolder
        and RubyLabel. Ruby comes from RequestSpin() (measured 3 -> 21 for
        one spin) and from battles. Storage is 200 at MaxStorageLevel 1 and
        was 5/200 in the session this was written, so it is not a near-term
        constraint.
      * Slots 7..10 are gated on rebirth level and say so on the plot
        ("Rebirth 3" ... "Rebirth 6"). Rebirth rewards are +50% money, +1 gun
        slot and a case unlock, and it KEEPS the guns and their levels -
        measured across a 0 -> 1 rebirth with five guns at levels 1..26.
      * SKINS ARE THE BIGGEST MULTIPLIER IN THE GAME AND COST ONLY TIME.
        RequestApplySkinMachine(uuid, "Machine_N") puts a gun into one of the
        plot's machines; it comes back wearing a skin worth 1.25x (Paper) to
        36x (Neon_Moss), rolled 55.11 / 27.53 / 10.08 / 4.54 / 1.94 / 0.75 /
        0.05 percent by skin rarity - about 4.3x expected, computed here from
        SkinsData rather than hardcoded. Ready is StartTime +
        GunRarityBasedTime[rarity], both server side, verified against the
        machine's own TimerLabel (90s of 300 showed "3m 31s"). The timer runs
        300s at rarity 1, 43,200s at 9 and 604,800s - a week - at 24.
        THE MACHINE TAKES THE GUN OFF THE PLOT (the record loses CurrentSlot),
        so the default feeds it SPARES only and lets RequestEquipBest seat the
        result. Machine time is the scarce resource, so candidates rank on
        value gained per SECOND OF MACHINE TIME, which favours mid rarities.
        A gun already inside a machine still has no skin and no slot, so it
        passes the filter and wins the ranking every pass while the server
        refuses it - the free machines then never fill and the note reads
        "applied 0" forever. Machine occupants are excluded up front.
      * PLAYER UPGRADES COST RUBY. RequestPlayerUpgrade("Money"|"Damage") are
        +10% income each per level. The shop PRINTS 100 ruby and the server
        charged 25 - another label that lies. They are bought ROUND ROBIN, not
        in a priority order: "Money, Damage" bought Money five times and Damage
        never once, because Money was always affordable.
      * SELLING IS THE WEAK POINT OF THIS SCRIPT AND IS DOCUMENTED AS SUCH.
        The game's own auto-sell is a filter on what DROPS, not a cleanup: with
        rarities 1-4 enabled, 161 spare guns of exactly those rarities sat in
        the inventory untouched while storage stayed pinned at 180/200. And its
        threshold is a RARITY, which is not value - a Spas_12 at rarity 3 with a
        big mutation was legitimately seated on the plot (base 1560, ahead of
        several r5 and r6 guns), and protecting rarity 3 for its sake also
        protects 26 junk r3 guns. Rarity cannot express "sell the worthless
        ones".
        The real cleanup is sellTrip(), which drives the shop's own UI and DOES
        work - 180 guns down to 37 in one pass. But the list controller WEDGES
        after a scripted pass: it never rebuilt again (72 rows against a 97-gun
        inventory, 3 of them resolving, the pad prompt inert) until the client
        was rejoined, and one more trip wedged it again. So it is a one-shot
        button and a last-resort attempt at 12% room, never a routine loop.
        Expect to sell by hand at the pad on a long unattended run.
      * STORAGE IS A HARD WALL AT 200. At the cap RequestOpenCase stops
        answering ("Inventory full, sell some guns!") and every later open is
        wasted; one session climbed 5 -> 158. Opening pauses near the cap.
        RequestSellGuns was never solved - {uuid}, uuid and {[uuid]=true} are
        all refused and the sell shop's list is only built when the pad opens
        it - so the clearing is done by the game's own auto-sell instead, which
        IS proven. It never enables a rarity that has a gun on the plot:
        whether the server spares a seated gun was never verified, and being
        wrong there sells the farm.
      * THE REBIRTH LADDER IS GATED ON NAMED GUNS, NOT ON MONEY ALONE. Every
        step wants one or two SPECIFIC guns plus a few "any gun of rarity N".
        Left purely income-driven this sat at R1 with $10.4M idle, Diamond sold
        out and Ruby locked behind R2, while R2 only needed a Glock_17 - about
        eight Bronze cases. Rolling the cheapest case that can drop the missing
        rarity found it on the first open and chained five rebirths.
      * A MISSING GetData MUST NOT READ AS A FRESH ACCOUNT. One nil answer made
        rebirth() report 0, which locked every case above Gold behind "not
        unlocked yet"; with the weakest slot already worth more than Gold the
        picker decided no case was worth buying and silently stopped spending
        while the balance piled up. The rebirth level is kept sticky.
      * THE UPGRADE PRICE IS PRINTED ABBREVIATED above a million - "$5.5M" next
        to "$1,142". Reading only the digits turned 5,500,000 into 5, which made
        a level 23 gun the cheapest upgrade on the plot with a 0s payback,
        pinned it at the top of the ranking every pass and had the server refuse
        it forever. The suffix ladder is CALIBRATED from the game's own
        Library.FormatNumber.FormatCompact by rendering 1e3 .. 1e63 and keeping
        the letters it answers with, so it matches the labels by construction.
        An unknown suffix is REFUSED rather than dropped.
      * THE PER-SLOT INCOME USED FOR PAYBACK IS MEASURED, NOT CONFIGURED. Each
        collect knows what that slot had pending and how long since its own last
        collect, which is an exact server-side rate for free. GunData's
        Money_Per_Sec ran about 5x low against it, and using it made every
        upgrade look five times worse than it was.
      * RequestPlaceGun(uuid, "Slot_5") returns false and stayed UNPROVEN.
        The slot's PlacePrompt is 10-stud gated and only opens the inventory
        UI; the real placement call was never captured. RequestEquipBest
        covers the job, so nothing here depends on placing by hand.
      * RequestAutoBuy(<case>) returns false in every argument shape tried
        and is likewise unproven. This script buys its cases itself.

-- Trivially cheap steps are let through on purpose: blocking a $2,500 case that
-- repays in a second in order to save for a $100M rebirth is backwards.

-- A case already sitting in OwnedCases is paid for, so it is opened before any
-- money is spent and WITHOUT asking the picker whether it beats the plot - the
-- money is gone either way and a sunk case can only add. This was found the
-- hard way: the account had 55 Diamond, 30 Gold, 3 Amethyst and 1 Ruby case
-- unopened (68 Diamond bought against 25 total rolls) while the script sat
-- there deciding that no case was worth BUYING. Richest first, by expected
-- value, so the good ones are not left behind if the inventory cap ever bites.
-- AN OWNED CASE IS FREE TO KEEP BUT NOT FREE TO OPEN. The case itself costs
-- nothing to sit in OwnedCases, but opening it spends an INVENTORY SLOT, and
-- storage - not money - is what stops the farm. Measured on a developed plot:
-- 393 Bronze, 94 Gold, 84 Silver and 60 Diamond cases in stock, all bought
-- earlier, each expected to produce a gun worth about 8 against a plot floor of
-- 450. Grinding through those is what "it keeps spinning bad cases" looks like:
-- hundreds of opens, hundreds of junk guns, storage full, and nothing gained.
--
-- So an owned case is opened only if it can actually help - either its expected
-- improvement clears minOpenGain of the floor, or it is a decent vehicle for the
-- rarity the next rebirth is waiting on. Everything else stays in the inventory,
-- where it costs nothing and is still there after the next rebirth raises the
-- ceiling and makes it worth opening.

-- the game's OWN auto-sell does the job server side and that one is proven.

-- toggles in both directions while the RETURN VALUE alternated correctly, so
-- the return is the only truth available and reaching a wanted state means
-- toggle, read the answer, toggle again if it went the wrong way.

--     verified, and being wrong there sells the farm - so the question is

--   * adaptive mode takes the threshold from the weakest rarity actually
--     placed, so it tightens by itself as the plot improves. Measured on a

-- A skin machine takes a gun, holds it for a time set by that gun's RARITY, and
-- hands it back wearing a skin whose Multiplier goes straight into its income.
-- The ladder runs 1.25x (Paper) to 36x (Neon_Moss) and the rarity roll is
-- 55.11 / 27.53 / 10.08 / 4.54 / 1.94 / 0.75 / 0.05 percent, which comes out at
-- about 4.3x expected. It is the largest multiplier in the game and the only one
-- that costs nothing but waiting.
--
-- THE MACHINE TAKES THE GUN OFF THE PLOT - the record loses CurrentSlot the
-- moment it goes in. So the default feeds it SPARE guns only: a Kriss Vector
-- earning 8K/s parked in a machine for its 12 hour rarity-9 timer loses more
-- than the skin returns for most of a day, while a spare costs nothing and
-- RequestEquipBest seats it by itself once it comes back worth more than the
-- weakest slot. skinPlaced lifts that restriction for anybody who wants it.
--
-- Machine time is the scarce resource, so the pick maximises value gained per
-- SECOND OF MACHINE TIME rather than raw value - the timer is 300s at rarity 1
-- and 604,800s (a full week) at rarity 24, so mid rarities win.
