--
-- This is louder than anything else in this script. An auto-farm looks like
-- somebody playing fast; a character that never takes damage is the single most
-- obvious pattern there is if the developers ever add a server-side health
-- check. Off by default, and it is a deliberate choice, not a default.
--
-- It also does NOT feed you: hunger still falls, and with this on a starving

-- WARNING, measured: this does NOT make you immortal. Writing Health is not
-- corrected by the server, so the on-screen bar stays full - but the server
-- keeps its own damage tally and its own death trigger, and it killed a
-- character whose local bar was still green. Treat this as cosmetic smoothing
-- of the bar, never as protection; the hover above is the defence that works.
--
-- Polling every 0.1s was not enough: a single hard hit crosses the whole bar
-- inside one tick, Health lands on 0, and a restore after the fact is too late
