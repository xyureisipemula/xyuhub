    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Roll a boss onto your plot, beat it, it drops an anime unit into your
    chest, you take the good ones out of the chest and place them on a slot
    where they deal damage to the NEXT boss and pay money per second forever.
    Money buys seven stat upgrades and per-unit levels.

    Plain vanilla Roblox: 59 named remotes under ReplicatedStorage.Remotes,
    nothing blanked, every config require-able from the client.

    The loop, as measured through the bridge on 2026-09-21:

      collect money (Claimer touch)  ->  boss dead? roll a new one
        ->  AttackBoss("Click") at the server's own pace
        ->  score every unit in the chest, take the keepers out
        ->  place a keeper on a free slot, or swap out a weaker one
        ->  spend money: stat upgrades by payback, then unit levels

    Verified facts this script is built on (do not re-derive):

      * ATTACKBOSS IS SERVER-CAPPED AT ABOUT ONE HIT PER SECOND, and the
        game's own AutoClickerController already saturates it. Measured: 50
        FireServer calls paced at 10/s over 5.9s produced FIVE DamageEffects
        echoes, against FOUR in a 5s window where this script fired nothing
        at all. Clicking faster is pure waste - the packrng lesson in a new
        game. The script paces itself at 1/s and never bursts.
      * THE DAMAGE COMES FROM THE PLACED UNITS, not from the click. Each
        placed unit ticks its own server-side attack (PlaySpecialAttackEffect
        then a DamageEffects echo), which is why unit quality is the only
        real lever on kill speed and therefore on the whole economy.
      * A UNIT'S TRUE VALUE IS COMPUTABLE BEFORE YOU TOUCH IT, and this is
        the heart of the script. CharacterConfig.GetInfo(id) gives
        AttackDamage / MoneyPerSecond / Rarity for all 163 characters,
        MutationConfig.GetInfo(m).DamageBoost gives the mutation factor
        (Normal 1, Golden 1.2, Diamond 1.5, Super 2.5, Ultra 4, Omega 8) and
        PetLevelConfig.GetDamageMultiplier / GetMoneyMultiplier give the
        level curve (1.08 and 1.1 per level). The game's OWN functions are
        called rather than the formula rebuilt.
        Validated against the live billboard: Dragon Slayer (Natsu, Epic,
        AttackDamage 1897) at Lv.21 -> 1897 x 4.6610 x 2.22 damage stat =
        19,625, the slot read "19K DMG"; money 1327.9 x 6.7275 = 8,935, the
        slot read "8.9K$/s". Exact.
      * RARITY BEATS LEVEL, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT. Measured on the live
        plot: Dragon Slayer, Epic, LEVEL 1 = 4.2K DMG against Star Stand
        User, Rare, LEVEL 24 = 1.3K DMG. A fresh Epic is three times the
        level-24 Rare. Ranking on level, or on "it is upgraded so it must be
        better", throws the better unit away - the user flagged this before
        the numbers did.
      * THE CHEST HAS A HARD CAP OF 25 AND A FULL CHEST STOPS THE GAME. No
        new unit can drop while it is full, so beating bosses stops paying
        anything at all. Keeping headroom outranks keeping a marginal unit,
        which is why pruneChest() runs before placement and not after.
      * Money is collected by firetouchinterest on Plot.Claimer.Hitbox and it
        is NOT position gated - verified from 41 studs, Money 505K -> 1.9M in
        one touch with five slots' takings pending.
      * Placing needs the body. Equip the Tool, pin the root part on
        Slot.Holder for ~1.5s, then fireproximityprompt(Holder.SlotProximity)
        (10 studs, hold 0). Verified: a Dragon Slayer went into Slot6.
        Unlike the wings-style games THE PLOT DOES NOT RE-SORT on placement,
        so a slot index is a stable handle here.
      * A PLACED UNIT'S UID lives on the slot's visual model:
        Slot.SlotVisual_<CharacterId>:GetAttribute("UID").
      * UPGRADING A UNIT IS A UI CALL, NOT A REMOTE.
        Remotes.UpgradePet:FireServer(uid) is a DEAD END - fired against a
        real uid with the money in hand it moved nothing: no level, no
        charge, no error. The working path is the slot's own SurfaceGui
        button, and it answers on MouseButton1Click (2 connections), NOT on
        Activated (0 connections - the handler lives in an Actor VM).
        Verified: Lv.21 -> Lv.22, 19K -> 21K DMG, Money 1.6M -> 1.5M against
        an 81K price label.
      * Remotes.BuyUpgrade:FireServer("<StatKey>") takes one string out of
        StatsConfig.Order - Summoner, Luck, Damage, AutoRoll, Slots,
        RespawnDelay, WalkSpeed. Verified: Damage Lv.15 -> Lv.16, Money
        597K -> 505K against a 91K price label.
      * Codes go through Remotes.Communication:FireServer("RedeemCode", CODE)
        - read out of CodesFrame.Main.CodesController's upvalues, not
        guessed. CodeConfig carries 17 of them including three money codes
        worth 7M total. Verified end to end (every one came back
        CodeRedeemFailed on an account that had already redeemed them).
      * The boss is the child of Plot.BossSpawn carrying Health / MaxHealth
        ATTRIBUTES, which is the kill oracle. Its Humanoid reads inf/inf and
        is worthless.
      * Rolling is fireproximityprompt(Plot.BossRoller.Hitbox.RollPrompt),
        15 studs. The AutoRoll stat maxes at level 2 and then the game rolls
        by itself, so this is a fallback, not the main path.

    THE TRAP THAT WILL COST YOU AN HOUR IF YOU DO NOT READ IT:

      * `bridge.py spy` BREAKS THIS GAME. With the FireServer/__namecall hook
        installed the game's OWN calls stop arriving - rolling does nothing
        and the chest collects nothing, silently, while the client looks
        perfectly healthy. Measured 2026-09-21: the user reported "I cannot
        roll or collect any more", `spy off` fixed it immediately and nothing
        else was changed. Capture incoming traffic with a plain
        OnClientEvent connection instead; never leave the spy on in this game.

    Deliberately NOT automated, and why:

      * Everything Robux-priced: the Autoclicker gamepass (59), x2 Super Luck
        (99), x2 Damage, x2 Offline Rewards, the Starter Pack, the LIMITED
        product podiums and every RobuxBuyButton on the upgrade cards.
      * Trading. A trade remote exists; nothing in this script touches it.
      * FuseUnits / AwakenUnit / RerollMutation / PlaceArtifact / JoinRaid are
        mapped in the recon but unimplemented - they are left out rather than
        shipped half-measured. The Infinity Castle IS implemented (castleStep,
        CONFIG.autoCastle) and is the strongest feature here.
      * Selling is ON, but it can only ever reach a unit that has already lost
        the contest for every slot - the ranking runs first, the sale second.

-- THE SPEND PLAN, in value order, with a level cap per stat.
--
-- This is not a guess. SummonerLuckConfig was read out of the game: each
-- Summoner level moves the CENTRE of the roll distribution up one whole rarity
-- tier (GetCenterTierIndex(L) = L-1), while the Luck stat's entire 80-level
-- ladder costs 7.4e17 and buys 0.35*log2(4.95) = +0.81 tiers. Summoner levels
-- 1->9 buy +8 tiers for 3.33e15 - roughly 2,200x more tier per dollar. The
-- first build of this ranked Damage first and left Summoner sitting at level 3
-- for 7.7M with 600M in the bank, which is the single worst call it made.
--
-- Caps exist because these ladders stop being worth it long before they max:
-- RespawnDelay is 1.19e7 for levels 1-10 (3.00s -> 2.28s) and 8.65e12 for the
-- rest, and Luck is only worth its early levels.
-- `share` overrides the per-buy spend cap for that entry. THE TWO BEST BUYS IN
-- THE GAME ARE ALSO THE TWO MOST EXPENSIVE, so a flat "never spend more than
-- half the balance" silently refuses exactly them: Unit Slots sat at 2B with a
-- 2B balance and was skipped every single cycle while the money went into
-- things that did not matter. Slots is allowed the whole balance because each
-- level is another unit both EARNING and FIGHTING - it raises income and kill
-- speed at once, which nothing else here does.
-- Roll Speed (RespawnDelay) sits second because it is THROUGHPUT: every second
-- shaved off the roll is another boss, another drop and another chance at a
-- rarity. It was capped at level 10 here on the strength of "levels 1-10 are
-- cheap, the rest costs 8.65e12 in total" - but that total is the whole ladder
-- to level 26, and the level-10 price is 11M against a billion-plus balance.
-- The cap would have stopped it dead exactly where it still pays. The price
-- growth (x2.37 a level) plus the spend share ends it on its own, which is the
-- right way to stop buying something: when it gets too expensive, not at a
-- number written down in advance.
-- ORDER MATTERS MORE THAN ANY SINGLE ENTRY, because this list starves whatever
-- sits at the bottom. Luck was sixth, behind RespawnDelay and Damage, and with
-- 2B in hand the cheap entries took the money every single cycle while Luck at
-- 919M was never reached - the project's own starvation trap, again.
--
-- Slots first: each level is another unit both EARNING and FIGHTING, the only
-- upgrade that raises income and kill speed at once. Luck second: it feeds the
-- same roll term as Summoner and is affordable far more often. Summoner is the
-- better deal per dollar (one whole rarity tier a level, against +0.81 tiers
-- for the Luck stat's entire 80-level ladder) but its price runs away into the
-- billions, so it is third and gets bought whenever it comes back into reach.

-- COMPARE AT THE SAME LEVEL, NOT AT THE CURRENT ONE.

-- A placed unit levelled 50 times out-scores a freshly dropped one of a far
-- better rarity, so comparing "as they stand" refuses every upgrade: measured
-- with a level 50 Demon Progenitor at 5.82e14 holding the weakest slot while
-- five MAGIC units sat in the chest at 1.08-1.73e14, all rejected - even
-- though a Magic at that same level is about 1.45e16, twenty times better.
-- The same mistake made the rarity filter switch off Fighter while the plot
-- was still full of the weaker Evil tier.
--
-- Levels are cheap and get rebought in seconds (541 in a single pass here),
-- while a rarity gap is permanent. RARITY IS THE PRIORITY; the level a unit
-- happens to be sitting at must not decide anything.
--
-- The reference is the HIGHEST level on the plot, computed from levels ALONE.
-- Deriving it from "the weakest unit" would be circular, because the weakest
-- unit is itself decided by a score taken at the reference level.
-- CACHED, because everything downstream asks for it and each answer walks the
-- whole plot. Uncached this was the single biggest cost in the script: used as
-- a table.sort comparator it re-scanned the plot on EVERY comparison, which
-- turned one chest sort into hundreds of plot walks - measured 355 ms for one
-- chestEntries() call and 97 ms for backpackTools(), the latter running twice
-- a second. That is what the heavy lag spikes were, and they were ours.

--
--     SetAutoDelete:FireServer(<floor>, <rarityName>, <boolean>)
--
-- Firing it with just (rarity, true) - the obvious two-argument guess - does
-- nothing at all and reports nothing, which is what made this look impossible
-- earlier. Verified end to end: AutoDeleteRarities came back from the server
-- with Uncommon = true after one call.
--
-- The rule: a rarity is switched off once even its STRONGEST member, rolled
-- with the BEST mutation in the game, could not beat the weakest unit already
-- on the plot. That is deliberately the most generous case for the rarity, so
-- nothing that could ever be useful is thrown away. It only ever switches
-- filters ON - a rarity the player turned off by hand is never turned back on
-- underneath them.
-- The ceiling is taken at the level the PLOT runs at, not at level 1. Judging
-- a rarity by a level-1 drop is what made this switch off Fighter while the
-- plot was still full of the weaker Evil tier: a fresh Fighter scored below a
-- level-50 Evil, even though the Fighter passes it within a few levels.

-- The single biggest lever in the game, and it is a client-authority hole.
--
-- The whole castle battle runs in PlayerGui.Main.CastleStartFrame's own
-- controller: AdvanceRoom() increments a LOCAL counter and tells the server,
-- and the server pays out InfinityCastleRewardConfig for that room without
-- ever checking that a fight happened. Measured on a controlled run: room
-- 1 -> 26 in 10.2s with exactly 25 fires accepted and zero battles.
--
-- The rate limit is on the STEP, not the amount - room 250 asked for from
-- room 2 was refused, while +1 steps always land. Measured acceptance:
-- 0.40s spacing 100%, 0.35s about 75%, 0.06s about 1%. So it is paced at
-- 0.42s and never bursts.
--
-- Depth is what unlocks the rewards: MutationCrystal at 150, AwakeningGem at
-- 175, OniPotion (x3 luck AND money AND damage) at 250 and AngelicPotion (x5
-- on all three) at 300. Those two potions have no Robux path at all - the
-- castle is the only way to get them.
-- The team the castle run is started with. It has to come from the PLACED
-- units: the game's own "equip best" reads Backpack Tools, and with every unit
-- sitting on a slot the backpack is empty, which is why clicking the castle
-- button by hand starts an empty run that cannot clear anything.
