--[[ phantomforces.lua - Phantom Forces (StyLiS Studios), place 292439477

  ESP, aim assist and a trigger for the one shooter in this hub that actively
  fights being read. Nothing here fires a remote, requires a module or touches
  the game's Actor VM: every value below comes out of Instances, and the two
  inputs go through the real mouse.

  ============================================================================
  WHAT PHANTOM FORCES DOES TO SCRIPTS, all measured 2026-09-18 on a live server
  ============================================================================

  1. EVERY NAME IS A RANDOM STRING, including the ones you would never check.
     `game.Players` THROWS - "Players is not a valid member of DataModel" -
     because the service is renamed (`hUfmmK^` that session). The DataModel
     itself reads `Ugc` one minute and `JM[RzIP7lZf` the next. The team folders,
     the character models and every part in them are random too.

     So: `game:GetService(...)` everywhere, never `game.X`, and nothing in this
     file looks anything up by name except the handful of REAL names the game
     cannot obfuscate because its own GUI templates use them (`NameTagGui`,
     `PlayerTag`, the HUD labels).

  2. THERE IS NO ROBLOX CHARACTER. `Player.Character` is nil for everybody,
     `Player.Team` is nil and the Teams service is EMPTY. The real bodies are
     Models in `workspace.Players.<team folder>.<model>`, and each one is six
     parts of 0.001 studs (the replicated skeleton) plus a folder of ~18
     MeshParts (what you actually see).

  3. THE MODELS ARE DESTROYED AND REBUILT CONSTANTLY. Measured with
     ChildAdded/ChildRemoved on both folders: 55 adds and 52 removes in 15
     seconds with 15 players on the server. A model reference is worthless
     within a few seconds, so nothing here caches one: the ESP pool is keyed by
     PLAYER NAME and the world is re-enumerated every frame. Cheap - two
     folders, fifteen models.

  4. THE IDENTITY IS IN THE NAMETAG, AND SO IS THE HEAD. Every model carries a
     `NameTagGui` BillboardGui whose `PlayerTag` TextLabel holds the real player
     name - both teams, whether the tag is visible or not. And the PART IT HANGS
     ON IS THE HEAD: verified against the six parts sorted by height, the tag
     holder was the topmost every time. That is the whole rig problem solved
     without a single name match.

  5. HEALTH DOES NOT REPLICATE RELIABLY. The nametag has a `Health` frame with a
     `Percent` bar, and it is present on some reads and absent on others - 15
     tags in one sweep, zero of them carrying it. So this script shows health
     WHEN THE GAME ITSELF PUBLISHES IT and draws nothing otherwise, rather than
     printing a made-up 100.

  6. THE CAMERA FIGHTS BACK. CameraType is Scriptable and the game rebuilds the
     CFrame from angles it keeps itself. Measured with eight 5 deg writes: the
     write survives the frame it is made in and is then thrown back - every
     following sample read 0.01-0.05 deg against the PREVIOUS orientation and
     ~5 deg against the wanted one. Same shape as BloxStrike, so the delivery
     default here is MOUSE, not camera. Auto still probes, in case a future
     update changes it.

  7. `keypress` IS A DEAD STUB. Probed with F13 and counted at
     UserInputService.InputBegan: keypress 0 arrived, mouse1click 1,
     VirtualInputManager 1 for both key and button. So the trigger uses
     mouse1click with a VirtualInputManager fallback, it PROBES which one works
     at start-up instead of preferring whichever exists, and the panel names the
     winner - a trigger that cannot fire looks exactly like one that is never
     armed.

  8. THE CLIENT RUNS IN AN ACTOR VM (getactors 1, getrunningscripts 0, 2702
     loaded modules), so a __namecall hook in the main VM sees none of the
     game's traffic - do not go looking for the shot path that way. The ESP,
     the aim assist, the trigger and the recoil control do not need it.

     THE GUN MODS AND SILENT AIM DO, and this is the single thing most likely to
     make somebody report the script as broken. One Roblox debug flag,
     `DebugRunParallelLuaOnMainThread`, puts that code on the main thread; a
     flag only takes effect on a FRESH JOIN. This file therefore SETS IT WHEN IT
     STARTS - setting it changes nothing in the running client - so the next
     join is hookable whether or not anybody read a panel. Measured on a user's
     client in the middle of three "silent aim does not work" reports: flag
     false, getactors 1. It had never been switched on by anyone.

  9. NOTHING OF OURS LIVES IN `_G`. With that flag on, the game's code shares
     this Lua state, and `_G` is the table every script in a state can read.
     All state is in `getgenv()` (debug handle: `getgenv().__SELPF_DBG`), with
     `_G` kept only as the fallback for an executor that has no getgenv.

 10. HOOKS GO IN ONE AT A TIME, WHEN A SWITCH ASKS FOR ONE. Every patched
     function is one more thing a client-side check could hold against its own
     copy, so a panel with everything off patches nothing at all. And every
     hook body is wrapped in a pcall: these run inside the game's own shot
     pipeline, where an error is not a dead feature but a gun that stops
     firing - which is what "it worked and then stopped" turned out to be.

  What is NOT in here, on purpose: nothing writes health, position, speed or a
  hitbox size, and no remote is fired. Phantom Forces validates movement server
  side and has done for years; the honest camera-and-mouse toolkit is the whole
  offer.

-- where this script keeps its own state, and why it is not in _G
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- With the debug flag below, the game's own code runs in the SAME Lua state as
-- this script - that is the whole point of the flag - and `_G` is the table
-- every script in a state shares. A handful of `__SELPF*` keys sitting in it is
-- something the client could look for in three lines, so none of it lives there
-- any more. `getgenv()` is the executor's own environment: it survives a
-- re-execute the same way and the game has no path to it.
--
-- `_G` stays as the fallback for an executor without getgenv, because losing the
-- generation guard - doubled loops, stacked hooks - is worse than being visible.
-- AND THE FALLBACK HAS TO BE STICKY. `getgenv` is not reachable from every way
-- of starting a script: measured on this machine, a chunk loaded through the
-- executor's own MCP channel saw no `getgenv` at all and landed in `_G`, while
-- the same file loaded through the bridge found it. If one run then picked the
-- executor table and the next picked `_G`, the two would be watching different
-- generation counters - and that is the doubled-loops, stacked-hooks failure
-- this guard exists to prevent. So: prefer getgenv, but if an earlier run of
-- this script in this VM is already living in `_G`, stay there with it.

-- THE FFLAG, and why everything below depends on it
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Phantom Forces runs its whole client in an Actor VM. From the main Lua state
-- that is a wall: `getgc` cannot see its tables, `hookfunction` cannot bite on
-- its methods, and every packet it sends carries a rolling key that lives in
-- there as an upvalue. Measured before: getgc 388844 objects, getactors 1.
--
-- Roblox has a debug flag that puts parallel Lua on the main thread:
--
--     setfflag("DebugRunParallelLuaOnMainThread", "true")   -- then REJOIN
--
-- After the rejoin the same client reads getactors **0** and getgc **742648** -
-- the game's own state is now in reach. Everything on the GUN MODS page exists
-- only in that mode; the ESP, the aimbot, the triggerbot and the recoil
-- compensation work either way, so the script does not insist on it.
--
-- The flag only takes effect on a fresh join, which is why this is offered as a
-- button rather than done silently: it teleports the player back into the same
-- server and that is not something a panel should do behind their back.

--
-- hookfunction cannot be undone: hooking the same function twice stacks

--
-- LAZY, and that is a deliberate change. Every patched function is one more
-- thing a client-side check can hold against its own copy, and the first build
-- patched all of it - the stat lookup, the animation length, the bullet
-- constructor, the network send and one function per recoil table - the moment
-- the script started, for a session that usually wanted one of them. Nothing is
-- hooked now until the switch that needs it is turned on: a silent-aim-only run
-- patches two functions instead of six or more, and a panel sitting there with
-- everything off patches none at all.
--
-- HOOK_VERSION is bumped whenever a hook BODY changes. A re-execute cannot
-- replace an installed hook - it can only stack a second one - so the honest
-- move is to notice that the live hooks are older than this file and say so,
-- rather than run a panel whose switches quietly drive last version's code.

-- Read straight off a captured `newbullets` payload: every bullet carries
-- `acceleration = (0, -196.2, 0)` and a velocity whose magnitude is the weapon's
-- `bulletspeed` - 2950 for the AN-94, 2800 for the HOWA TYPE 20 and the WA2000,
-- 1400 for the HARDBALLER. At 300 studs a 2800 stud/s bullet is in the air for
-- 0.107 s and has dropped 1.1 studs, which is most of a head; at 600 it is 4.5
-- studs and the shot goes under the feet. An assist that aims at the head
-- position therefore misses at exactly the ranges where an assist is worth
-- having.
--
-- The whole stat block is readable from the MAIN VM: the weapon folders under
-- ReplicatedStorage.Content.ProductionContent.WeaponDatabase each hold a
-- ModuleScript, and requiring it from here returns a private copy - useless for
-- changing anything, perfect for reading 95 static numbers.
--
-- WHICH weapon is held is not stored anywhere readable, so it is identified by
-- its FIRE RATE: the HUD prints it ("[580 S]"), the loadout arrives in the
-- `newspawn` payload, and the entry whose `firerate` matches is the one in our
-- hands. No slot-index mapping to guess and nothing to keep in sync when the

-- the hitbox magnet: removed, and why
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- It worked exactly as designed and it still did nothing, so it is gone rather
-- than sitting on a page pretending. Moving an enemy anchor onto the bullet
-- line made this client grade its own shot against the moved box and send the
-- hit itself - traced, with NetworkClient.send showing bullethit=3 going out on
-- a valid key - and the server confirmed none of them. Phantom Forces
-- re-validates the trajectory, so a hit claim that does not match where the
-- bullet actually went is discarded.
--
-- The same measurement closes hit-part spoofing: rewriting Torso to Head on a
-- legitimate hit comes back from the server with the part echoed but the
-- headshot flag set FALSE and the damage unchanged at 56.0. The server decides.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- movement and world
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The character object is reachable once the client runs on the main thread, and
-- it hands out the movement directly: `setWalkSpeedMult`, `setStamina`,
-- `getSpeed`, `getRootPart`, `isGrounded`. Measured: setWalkSpeedMult(2.5) took
-- the peak speed from 14 to 25.5 and the ground covered from 2.5 to 8.2 studs a
-- second, so the multiplier is real and something clamps it below what is asked.
--
-- What does NOT work, measured: writing `CharacterConfig.adrenalineMovementConfig
-- .*.jumpHeight` from 3.3 to 14 left the jump at 2.9 studs. The character reads
-- that config when it is built, so changing it afterwards changes nothing - no
-- super jump ships on the back of it.
--
-- Phantom Forces validates movement server side. Speed is therefore presented
-- with the measured speed next to it rather than as a promise, and it is left to
-- the player to decide how far to push a number the server is watching.

-- it fell straight back - because the step recomputes the fall every frame from
-- `workspace.Gravity`, which CharacterObject reads live (`local v159 =
-- -workspace.Gravity`).
--
-- Set that to 0 first and the same push holds: the same test went from 2.8 to
-- 28.0 studs and stayed at 28.0 after letting go, with no correction from the
-- server. Gravity is restored the moment flight is switched off, and captured on
-- the rising edge rather than assumed to be 128 - it is a map property and a

-- the feature switched OFF. That shipped and had to be undone by hand.
