--[[ arsenal.lua - "Arsenal" by ROLVe (place 286090429)

  Second shooter in this collection, and the genre file
  (.claude/docs/games-shooters.md) carries everything that transfers from
  counterblox. What follows is only what ARSENAL does differently, all of it
  measured through the bridge before a line of this was written.

  * **Enemy positions replicate in full.** Every player's
    `Character.HumanoidRootPart.Position` reads correctly at any range, through
    any wall - ten players, ten live positions, including the ones sitting in
    the lobby at y = -403. No server-side culling, so the ESP is honest.
  * **The character is R15 and carries the same hitbox trio as Counter Blox:**
    `Head` (1.25, CanCollide, invisible), `FakeHead` (0.625, the visible one)
    and **`HeadHB`** (1.45 x 1.30 x 1.30) - HeadHB is the headshot box. On top
    of those Arsenal has a fourth part the other game does not: **`Hitbox`**,
    4.5 x 4 x 4 studs, transparent, CanQuery true. That is the body hitbox and
    it is what the hitbox page below resizes.
  * **`Character.EquippedWep` is a StringValue that is EMPTY for everybody.**
    Measured on nine players in a live round: not one of them had a value in
    it, so it is set locally and never replicates. The enemy's weapon is NOT
    readable from the character.
  * **...but in the default mode it is derivable exactly.** `Player.Status.Level`
    replicates for every player, and `ReplicatedStorage.Levels[<level>]` is a
    StringValue naming the gun for that level - 1 = M4A1 up to 32 = Golden Gun.
    Arsenal's standard mode is a gun game, so level IS weapon, and the ESP
    prints it without guessing.
  * **`Player.Status` is the per-player oracle** and it replicates for everyone:
    `Level`, `Alive`, `Team` (the string "TRC"/"TBC"/"Spectator"), `SessionKills`.
    `Player.ScoreFolder` adds `Kills`, `Deaths`, `Streak`, `Headshots`,
    `Backstabs`, `Damage`, `Captures`. `Player.Ping` is there too.
  * **`Player.Status.Team` and `Player.Team` DISAGREE.** IndianaJulian2 read as
    `TRC` through the Teams service and `TBC` through `Status.Team` in the same
    second. The Teams object is not the enforced one, so nothing here uses it -
    and because the standard mode is a free-for-all anyway, the default target
    rule is "everybody but me" with a dropdown for the team modes.
  * **`workspace.Map.Clips`** - the same invisible movement brushes as Counter
    Blox, collision group `Clips`, transparent, CanQuery true. Left in the
    raycast filter every enemy reads as "behind a wall". Filtered here.
  * **`workspace.Ray_Ignore`** exists and is the game's own ignore folder.
  * **`workspace.HWRAP_<name>`** is the third-person WEAPON model, not a hitbox -
    every part in it is CanQuery false, so it can neither block a ray nor be
    shot. It is only used here as "this player currently holds a gun".
  * The round HUD is plain text: `GUI.Timer.GM` (mode), `.Sub`, `.R` / `.B`
    (the two team scores), `.NW` (next weapon), and `GUI.PlayersAlive.Num`.
    `ReplicatedStorage.WinnerScore` holds the leader's NAME.

  The aim assist moves the CAMERA and nothing else, exactly as in counterblox:
  no remote is fired, no hit is fabricated. The HUMANISE page is the part that
  is new here - reaction delay, wind-up, a smooth noise walk, an overshoot, a
  deadzone, a degrees-per-second ceiling and a break-off chance, all on top of
  the two smoothing divisors. A perfect tracker is what an aimbot looks like;
  every one of those knobs exists to take a piece of that away.

  The hitbox page is the one feature here that is NOT camera-only: it resizes
  the enemy's own `Hitbox` part on this client. Whether Arsenal grades a hit
  against the client's copy of that part is not something this session could
  measure (the account was in the lobby the whole time), so it ships with a
  readout that says so and it restores every part it touched when switched off.

  ---- 2026-09-25: Arsenal was rebuilt, and most of the above moved ----------

  * **No Actor any more.** `getactors()` is 0 and the whole client is plain
    ModuleScripts under `ReplicatedFirst.Client` - the shot path is readable
    from the main VM without the FFlag.
  * **The real HP is `Player.NRPBS.Health`.** `Humanoid.Health` reads 100 on
    everybody, dead ones included (-10.99 in NRPBS, 100 on the Humanoid), so
    the health bar was always full and a corpse counted as a live target.
  * **`Player.NRPBS.EquippedTool` names everybody's weapon, in every mode.**
    The level ladder only works in the gun-game modes: in "Randomizer" the
    `Levels` folder is EMPTY, so the old weaponInfo() answered nil, the
    "Firearms only" gate (on by default) stayed shut, and the aim and the
    trigger never ran at all. That was the "aimbot does not work" report.
  * **`ReplicatedStorage.wkspc.FFA` is the free-for-all flag** (next to
    `TwoTeams`, `gametype`). Randomizer is a TEAM mode that no word list knew,
    so every team mate was drawn as an enemy.
  * **The shot is `GeneralFunctions.cast(ray, ignoreList)`**, called from the
    `FireBullet` handler in `Client.Game.BulletsAndProjectiles` with a ~1000
    stud ray from the camera. It holds `workspace.Raycast` as an upvalue, so a
    `__namecall` spy never sees it - `hookfunction` does. The hit then goes out
    through the game's own NetClient (`HitPart` = packet 0 on
    `ReplicatedStorage.###zzz###`). Bending that ray is the silent aim, and it
    was measured against the server: 3 of 4 bent shots with the crosshair
    67-181 px off the target came back as a kill (target Deaths +1, own Kills
    +1, own Headshots +1); the fourth enemy was killed by somebody else.
  * **Recoil is `ShakeCam`**, a local of the same handler (it reads
    `RecoilControl` and `ads`); hooking it to return early leaves the shot
    intact. **`Spread.calcspread` must NOT be hooked to return 0** - the ammo
    goes down and no ray is ever cast. No spread is done inside the cast hook
    instead, by pointing the ray down the crosshair.
  * **`FireRate` / `Ammo` / `ReloadTime` are read live off
    `ReplicatedStorage.Weapons.<gun>`**: a quarter of the AK74's FireRate put
    30 rays out in one second instead of ~13. Whether the SERVER credits a
    faster cadence was not measured - the panel says so.
  * **`Humanoid.WalkSpeed` is reset by the game within 2 s** (31 -> 23), so the
    speed boost moves the root part instead of writing WalkSpeed.

-- The filter is "everything a BULLET would not stop on", which is not the same

-- parts. Two families of them, both found by measurement:
--
--  * `Map.Clips` - the movement clip brushes, collision group Clips, fully
--    transparent, CanQuery true. Solid to a player, invisible, and bullets pass
--    straight through. The same trap as Counter Blox.
--  * `Map.Ignore` - a folder whose NAME says ignore but whose contents are
--    mixed: 256 opaque collidable parts (real geometry, must stay) sitting next
--    to 37 `Floors`, 8 literally named `RAYCAST`, 4 `MainSt` and 2 `Glass`,

--
--   * `keyHeld` ends in IsMouseButtonPressed / IsKeyDown, which are false forever
--     on a client with MouseEnabled and KeyboardEnabled both off - so "Hotkey",
--     the DEFAULT for the aim assist, the trigger and the panic key, could never
--     become true.
--   * `firing()` read MouseButton1, so "While firing", the shot counter and the
--     recoil pass were dead too.
--   * the key recorder takes Keyboard on InputBegan and MouseButton on InputEnded
--     and nothing else, so a phone could not bind its way out of it.
--   * Roblox does NOT synthesise MouseMovement on a touch client - a camera drag
--     arrives as UserInputType.Touch - so the sensitivity calibration never got a
--     sample and rcsPass returned at its `sensYaw == 0` guard every frame.
