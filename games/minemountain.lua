    minemountain.lua - "[<E2><9B><B0>] Mine a Mountain"  (place 125927821145949)

    Verified against server-side values on 2026-08-21, account polpne.

    The loop the game wants: climb the mountain, mine crystals out of the rock,
    carry them down under a weight cap, sell them to the Crystal Buyer, spend
    the cash on carrying more.  A fresh mountain is generated every hour.

    How this game is wired, and why the script looks the way it does:

    * **A SMALL crystal does not have to be mined at all.**  Every crystal in
      `Workspace.Things.Crystals` carries its own ProximityPrompt, and for a
      `SizeClass` of "S" firing that prompt takes it straight out of the rock -
      no pickaxe swing, no terrain carving, whatever its tier.
    * **A MEDIUM or LARGE one is gated on the equipped pickaxe's RANK**, and
      this is the whole economy of the game.  See the long note above
      `pickaxeRank()`: rank must be >= the crystal's tier or the server refuses
      the break in silence.  Rank 1 leaves every crystal worth more than a few
      thousand dollars in the ground; rank 6 turned the exact two crystals that
      had refused everything into a $157M and a $27M pickup on a plain prompt.
      Swinging the pickaxe does NOT help - `DigRequest` carves terrain only.
    * **The server runs the hold timer itself.**  `fireproximityprompt(prompt)`
      opens the hold and the crystal lands in the inventory `HoldDuration`
      seconds later (1s for tier 1 up to 6.5s for tier 9).  There is no way to
      shorten it.  `Remotes.CrystalHoldComplete` looks exactly like the skip -
      the published rscripts autofarms all fire it - but it does NOTHING: a
      tier 1 crystal "succeeded" only because its hold is 1.0s and the test
      waited 1.4s, and the identical call against tier 2 (1.5s hold) was
      refused.  Do not re-add it.
    * **The body has to be pinned hard.**  The game runs a traction/ragdoll
      system that slides the character off any slope, so a plain CFrame write
      lands 8 studs from the target while reporting success and every pickup is
      then silently refused.  The pin writes CFrame **and** zeroes
      `AssemblyLinearVelocity` every Heartbeat, and the drift is checked before
      anything is fired.
    * **The base is a no-dig zone.**  `Modules.Tools.ZoneCheck.isInNoDiggingZone`
      is true for the whole shop area, which is where the decorative crystals
      around the stalls sit.  Digging there does nothing at all.
    * `SellRequest:FireServer("all")` sells the whole bag.  The bare call with
      no argument sells nothing and reports nothing.  Selling IS position gated
      - refused from 248 studs - so every trip has to come back down.
    * `UpgradeBuy:FireServer(key, index)` where the index is a BUNDLE, not a
      count: 1 buys one level, 2 buys five, 3 buys ten.  Any other number is
      ignored in silence.  `UpgradePrices:InvokeServer(key)` returns the three
      bundle prices for the current level.  Only "Weight" and "Air" exist.
    * **Backpacks do nothing, whatever the catalog says.**  Every entry in
      `ShopCatalog.Backpacks` advertises a `stats.WeightLimit` from 25 up to
      1700, which reads exactly like the carry ladder - it is not.  Measured:
      four of them bought for $3,900 and then equipped in turn (limit 25 ->
      75 -> 120) left `RealStats.CarryWeight` at 33 the whole time and the
      freeze threshold unchanged.  `CarryWeight` is the effective cap and the
      Weight upgrade is the only thing that moves it.  Never buy a backpack.
    * **The Gear category cannot be bought at all.**  `ShopCatalog.Gear` lists
      three jackets (`Warmth` 1-3) and three boots (`IceGrip` 1-3), but
      `ShopCatalog.getCategory` answers nil for every one of their ids and
      `ShopBuy` charges $0 and grants nothing.  There is no `Inventory.Gear`
      folder either.  It is unreleased content, so warmth is NOT purchasable
      and the altitude ceiling below is the only defence against freezing.
    * **Above the freeze line the character dies, and death is silent.**
      `FreezeThresholdStuds` (198.5 as measured, it moves) is where
      `IsFreezing` turns on.  A grab at y=563 came back with every prompt
      still Enabled, the crystal still in the world and `Humanoid.Health` at
      **0** - the body had frozen to death during the 5s hold and a corpse
      picks nothing up.  Nothing reports this; only the health does.
    * **Dying needs `ReviveBase`.**  The game does not auto-respawn; the
      corpse just lies there and every later action fails.
      `Remotes.ReviveBase:FireServer()` is the "Back to Base" button on the
      death panel and it puts the body at the shops with full health.
    * `PlayerData.RealStats` is the state oracle (Cash, CarryWeight, Height,
      AirCapacity, PlotCapacity, ...) and the carried crystals are RayValues
      under `PlayerData.Inventory.Crystals`, each with Value / WeightKg / Tier /
      UID as attributes.
    * Pickups produce **zero** outgoing remote traffic - prompts are handled
      server side and are invisible to a __namecall hook - so a pickup can only
      ever be confirmed by the inventory count moving.

    Never touched: every Robux product id in BombShopConfig / RadarShopConfig,
    the gamepass showcase, the ExtremeNuke offer and the gift shop.  Bombs and
    radars all have a real cashPrice as well, but radars only reveal crystals
    the script already reads straight out of the workspace, so they are worth
    nothing here.
