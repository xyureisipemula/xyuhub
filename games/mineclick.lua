--
-- The loop: clicking makes Strength, Strength makes levels, levels allow
-- rebirths, rebirths unlock better training areas and multiply everything. Cash
-- comes from loot lying in the mine, and cash buys pickaxes, which is what makes
-- walls break fast enough to reach the deeper stages.
--
-- THIS GAME HAS AN ANTI-CHEAT and it is the first one in this repo that does.
-- `ReplicatedFirst.AnticheatClient` ("ZAC") is a pure **executor fingerprint
-- scan**: it walks a list of ~50 globals (writefile, readfile, getgenv, gethui,
-- decompile, hookfunction, hookmetamethod, getconnections, identifyexecutor …)
-- and the first one that exists fires `ZAC_Report:FireServer(reason, detail,
-- "HIGH")` plus a jumpscare. What it does NOT do, verified by reading the whole
-- 13.8K source: no walkspeed check, no position check, no teleport check, no
-- magnitude check - the words do not appear once. So the farming below is
-- invisible to it; only the executor itself is what it looks for, and it fires
-- at most once per session (`u2` latches). Nothing here pokes ZAC.
--
-- Everything below is measured against the server, and the oracle is the
-- Replica: `require(RS.Client.DataClient):GetReplica().Data` carries Cash,
-- Strength, Rebirths, WallsBroken, BackpackSize, ExtraWalkSpeed, Pickaxes,
-- StagesUnlocked and Auras as real server-written values.
--
--   * `Remotes.Server.Click:FireServer()` takes NO arguments and credits from
--     anywhere. The server caps the CALL RATE at ~8.5/s: one call per frame
--     gained 43 Strength in 5s, three calls per frame gained 42 in the same 5s.
--     One per Heartbeat is the whole budget - a published script for this game
--     fires four per frame, which buys exactly nothing.
--     What each call is worth is the equipped pickaxe's Strength times the area
--     multiplier: 8.5/s with the Wood Pickaxe (Strength 1) became 20.6M/s once
--     the Hacked Pickaxe (Strength 750,000) was equipped. So the pickaxe is not
--     only a mining stat, it IS the click rate - buy it before anything else.
--   * Training areas multiply that: spawn 8.4/s against 12/s inside Coal Ore,
--     which is the x1.5 from TrainingList, dead on. The ladder is Coal x1.5 at 0
--     rebirths up to Demonite x10 at 15. Azurite x100, Emerald x25 and Amethyst
--     x15 carry a GamepassId and are never touched.
--   * **MINING NEEDS THE BODY AT THE WALL, and only at the LOWEST OPEN STAGE.**
--     Re-measured 2026-08-20 and this replaces the old claim that HitWall works
--     from any distance so the body was free to farm the click multiplier in a
--     training area. It does not:
--       - 8s of HitWall spam from the training area: 0 walls, 0 damage events.
--       - sitting in the hitbox centre: 0 walls, 0 damage events.
--       - standing SIX STUDS IN FRONT of the wall: all three walls of the stage
--         in 12s, 6 damage events.
--     The wall is CanCollide, so aiming at its own position pushes the body out
--     and leaves it metres away - which looks exactly like "mining does nothing".
--     And only the lowest open stage takes damage at all: hammering stage 4 or
--     10 while stage 3 still stood produced nothing whatsoever. Mining and
--     training are therefore two phases and cannot share a spot.
--   * **A STAGE IS FINISHED WHEN ITS WALLS ARE TRANSPARENT.** Every stage keeps
--     three walls at `Stages["Stage n"].Stages["1".."3"]`; a broken one reads
--     `Transparency = 1, CanCollide = false`. That is readable for every stage
--     from anywhere, which is what makes a global loot ranking possible. The two
--     signals tried before it were both wrong: `StagesUnlocked` is REACHED, not
--     finished (it read 1..10 while stages 3, 4, 6 and 10 all answered "Complete
--     Stage N First!" - TeleportToStage lets you pay past a stage, so it is not
--     even sequential), and `StageClient.BrokenWalls` only fills while you stand
--     in that stage's zone (nine of ten reached stages read 0/3 from across the
--     map, which made the collector allow nothing at all).
--   * **The loot cycle has three gates and missing any one of them looks exactly
--     like a broken script.** The loot itself lies at
--     `Stages["Stage n"].Spawnpoints.<GUID>` with `ItemId` / `StageId` /
--     `IsTaken` attributes:
--       1. It is picked up with an E press, not a touch. The ProximityPrompt is
--          a DESCENDANT of the spawn part (under the item model) and only exists
--          once the client has built it, so it has to be searched recursively
--          and waited for.
--       2. The stage has to be FINISHED - see the wall test above. An unfinished
--          one answers every pickup with "Complete Stage N First!" on
--          `Remotes.Client.Notification`, which is a usable signal in itself.
--       3. The backpack has to have room. At 5/5 every prompt answers "Backpack
--          is full! (Goto Surface)" and pays nothing - the state that had this
--          script teleporting onto loot all day for zero cash.
--     The payout is not per pickup either: `GotoSurface:FireServer()` empties the
--     bag (Storage 5 -> 0) and `SellAllLoot:FireServer()` pays for the load.
--     Measured: one full bag paid 93,840, and a 22s cycle of break -> collect ->
--     surface -> sell paid 399,750.
--   * `player.data.Storage` is how full the bag is, `Data.BackpackSize` the cap.
--     `Data.Inventory` stays empty the whole time and is NOT the inventory -
--     watching it is what hid the backpack gate for so long.
--   * The loot is a RACE. 223 spawn points exist and with 14 players on the
--     server only 0-9 are free at any moment - they refill on a cycle, they are
--     not created fresh (zero new instances in 20s). A teleporting bot wins that
--     race, which is the whole reason this script is worth running. Because it
--     is a race, the collector re-ranks after EVERY pickup instead of walking a
--     list it took once.
--   * **The ItemId IS the value.** A free spawn point carries only IsTaken,
--     ItemId and StageId and has no children at all until the client builds the
--     item next to you - so the "Revenue" billboard is unreadable from anywhere
--     that matters and the old code's billboard-first ranking silently collapsed
--     to "whatever is nearest". `ItemsList[id].Revenue` is the real figure and it
--     already carries the rarity: Rock 8, Crate 1.2M (Mythic), Alien Head 150M
--     (Godly), Whitehole 10.5B (Celestial), Jupiter 15B. That billion-fold spread
--     is why a good item three cleared stages away beats a Rock underfoot.
--   * Formulas out of the helpers, not guessed: level curve starts at 45 with
--     growth 1.095, rebirth needs level `25 + rebirths * 25`, cash multiplier is
--     `1 + rebirths * 0.2`, strength multiplier `1 + rebirths * 0.5`, backpack
--     costs `200000 * 2.85^(size-3)` and walkspeed `10000 * 1.4^extra`.
--     Verified against the balance: backpack 3 -> 4 charged exactly 200,000 and
--     walkspeed 0 -> 1 exactly 10,000.
--   * `PurchasePickaxe:FireServer(name, "Cash")` then `EquipPickaxe(name)`:
--     bought the Hacked Pickaxe (750,000 strength) for 80,000,000 and it landed
--     in Data.Pickaxes and got equipped. The `"Robux"` second argument is the
--     other way to pay and is never used here.
--   * `Rebirth:FireServer("Rebirth")` is refused below the level gate - fired at
--     level 11 against a required 25 it changed nothing at all, no error.
--
-- Robux, never touched: every `ProductId` / `GamepassId` entry in PickaxeList,
-- AurasList and TrainingList, the `"Robux"` argument on every purchase remote,
-- `Rebirth:FireServer("Skip")`, SkipStage and the whole Remotes.Admin folder.

-- A stage counts as DONE when it has no unbroken wall left, and that is what the

-- 10 and 12 were still refusing their loot. Defined here because freeLoot needs
-- it and a local is invisible above its definition.
-- Ask the SERVER, not the client cache. StageClient.BrokenWalls only fills from
-- BreakWall events, and those only arrive while the character stands in that
-- stage's zone - so once the body was parked in a training area to farm the
-- click multiplier, every stage but the one it had visited looked unfinished and
-- the script re-mined stage 2 forever while StagesUnlocked already read 14.
--
-- StagesUnlocked IS NOT A DONE LIST. Measured 2026-08-20 on a fresh account:
-- StagesUnlocked read {1, 2} while StageClient.BrokenWalls showed all three
-- walls of stage 1 AND stage 2 still standing (every entry false). Treating it
-- as "done" made the script skip both, jump to stage 3, hammer HitWall 22 times
-- against a stage the server will not accept, and then announce "walls are
-- throttled, rejoin the server" - a diagnosis that sent the user to restart
-- while the real answer was "you have not broken stage 1 yet". It also went on
-- to collect loot from a stage it had never opened, which the game answers with
-- "Complete Stage N First!".
--
-- It is also a plain ARRAY, so `unlocked[2]` only looked like a set lookup
-- because index happened to equal value.
--
-- The honest signal is the wall record: a stage is done when every wall in it is
-- marked broken. BrokenWalls only fills from BreakWall events and those only
-- arrive while the character is in that stage's zone, so an EMPTY record means
-- "not known to be done" - which is the safe answer, because working a stage
-- that is already clear costs one dwell window while skipping one that is not
-- costs the whole run.
-- WHICH STAGE IS FINISHED: READ THE WALLS THEMSELVES.
--
-- Every stage keeps its three walls at `Stages["Stage n"].Stages["1".."3"]`, and
-- a broken one is `Transparency = 1, CanCollide = false` while a standing one is
-- `Transparency = 0, CanCollide = true`. That is readable for EVERY stage, from
-- anywhere on the map, at any time - no cache, no bookkeeping, no guessing.
--
-- Verified 2026-08-20 against the server's own refusals:
--   stage 1  -> all three walls transparent   and loot was accepted
--   stage 4  -> all three walls solid         and "Complete Stage 4 First!"
--   stage 10 -> all three walls solid         and "Complete Stage 10 First!"
--
-- Three earlier attempts were wrong and each broke the whole run:
--   1. `StagesUnlocked` is REACHED, not finished - it read 1..10 while stages 3,
--      4, 6 and 10 were all still refusing their loot. TeleportToStage lets you
--      pay your way past a stage, so the list is not even sequential.
--   2. `StageClient.BrokenWalls` only fills from BreakWall events, and those only
--      arrive while the character stands in that stage's zone: nine of ten
--      reached stages read 0/3 from across the map. Using it meant freeLoot
--      allowed NOTHING - 0 items while four lay free - and the worker sat on
--      stage 1 forever. That is the "it only picks up one point and never moves
--      on" the panel was showing.
--   3. "everything below the highest reached is done" - same refutation as (1).

-- The deepest stage whose hitbox exists. Standing in it is the entire job: the
-- game's own StageClient zone handler picks the next unbroken wall and swings.
-- The stage to WORK ON is one deeper than the deepest one unlocked, because
-- breaking the walls in a stage is what unlocks it - measured: standing in the
-- stage 2 hitbox with StagesUnlocked = {1} broke three walls and the record came
-- back {1, 2}. TeleportToStage itself neither charges nor unlocks anything, so
-- the body simply parks in the next hitbox. Only when that stage is out of walls
-- does the target move on.
-- Work the LOWEST unfinished stage, not the deepest reachable one. Going deep
-- first is what left a trail of half-cleared stages whose loot could never be
-- taken, while the body hammered a wall far below that its pickaxe cannot chew.
-- The stage to work is the LOWEST unfinished one that is actually reachable.
-- Lowest first because the game clears in order - the server refuses loot from
-- any stage below one that is still open, so skipping ahead strands everything
-- behind it. Reachable means `<= maxUnlockedStage()`: a stage past that refuses
-- every hit, which is what produced the "walls are throttled, rejoin" nonsense.
--
-- `stageDone` is the LEARNED map, so a stage the server has never complained
-- about counts as open and gets worked - and the moment a pickup there is
-- refused, or its last wall falls, the map learns and the cursor moves on by
-- itself. Nothing here has to guess.
