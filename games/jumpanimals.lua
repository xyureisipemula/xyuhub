    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Carry-and-place plot income with the progression moved into JUMP POWER.
    Squat on the barbell to earn Jump XP, Jump XP raises Jump Power, Jump Power
    is what lets you enter the next area, you steal an egg from a guarded area,
    carry it home, place it in the pen, it hatches into an animal and pays cash
    per second forever.

    It is a near relative of stealegg: barbell -> treadmill, Jump Power ->
    Speed, animal index -> pet index. Unlike that game there is NO anti-cheat
    here - sweeps for AntiCheat / exploit / detector vocabulary over 5-7k live
    functions found nothing belonging to the game, so plain CFrame warping is
    used throughout.

    The loop, as measured through the bridge on 2026-09-16:

      stop squatting  ->  warp onto the best reachable egg, pin ~1.5s
        ->  fireproximityprompt(CollectPrompt)   CarriedEggCount 0 -> 1
        ->  warp onto the plot; arriving delivers by itself and the egg turns
            into a Backpack Tool "<Animal> Egg"
        ->  PlaceEggRequest:FireServer(tool.EggId, groundPosition)
        ->  resume squatting on the pad

    Verified facts this script is built on (do not re-derive):

      * TRAINING BLOCKS EVERY STEAL. While plr:GetAttribute("IsSquatting") is
        true the CollectPrompt does nothing at all - no error, no message, the
        prompt simply never pays out. StopSquattingRequest:FireServer() first,
        ALWAYS, and it works from any distance. This is the single easiest way
        to make the whole farm look broken and it cost a debugging round; the
        user spotted it before the numbers did. Same shape as the findegg
        "plr.Training stays true after warping off a treadmill" trap.
      * STARTING to squat is position gated, CONTINUING is not. Pinned on
        SquatZone.Floor.t the attribute flips within ~1s; fired from 605 studs
        with IsSquatting false it does nothing (0 XP in 6s). But once running,
        the server never revalidates position - measured 2.67 XP/s standing on
        a Winter egg 382 studs away against 2.50 XP/s on the pad itself. So the
        travel legs are free training; only the pickup needs the stop.
      * A CFrame warp alone does not start it. The character has to be PINNED
        on Heartbeat with AssemblyLinearVelocity zeroed - a warp that drifts a
        couple of studs leaves the server refusing while the client dutifully
        fires 4x/s, which reads exactly like a server gate and is not.
      * NEVER BURST SquatTrainingRequest. The client already fires it ~4 times
        a second by itself. An A/B over two 8s windows: client rate alone
        +20 XP (2.50/s), plus 16,920 extra FireServer calls +22 XP (2.75/s) -
        one tick of jitter. And the flood BACKFIRES: straight after it the
        server refused training entirely for ~40-60 seconds, silently, while
        the client kept firing. Training To Climb's flood trap in a new game.
      * A JUMP CANCELS THE SQUAT (Squats.JumpCancelEnabled, 0.5s grace), so the
        farm never jumps. There is no anchoring here, so there is also no
        stealegg-style "jump to release the root part" trick to want.
      * Eggs are completely readable without travelling. All ten areas
        replicate from the lobby; each model in Stages.<area>.SpawnedEggs is
        NAMED after its animal and carries Rarity, CPSMultiplier,
        SizeMultiplier, GrowthMultiplier, MutationList and NaturalSpawnPosition
        as plain attributes. So the global ranking is one GetChildren().
      * Delivery is ARRIVING ON THE PLOT, not a pad or a remote. Warping into
        the plot's Detector region took CarriedEggCount 1 -> 0 and put a Tool
        "Bunny Egg" in the Backpack. ReturnToBaseRequest is NOT used - it
        carries a ProductIdAttribute and costs TeleportCredits or Robux.
      * Placing is PlaceEggRequest:FireServer(eggId, groundPosition) where
        eggId is the TOOL'S OWN "EggId" attribute and groundPosition is a
        raycast hit inside the plot. Read out of EggPlacementController rather
        than guessed - its fire site reads Plot.Value, the Placement.RegionName
        child ("Detector"), and the tool's EggId. Verified: PlacedEggs 0 -> 1.
        Activating the tool instead sends NOTHING unless the real mouse happens
        to be pointing at ground, which is why :Activate() looks dead.
      * The egg runs a server timer - PlacedAt and HatchAt (unix, compare
        against workspace:GetServerTimeNow) plus a HatchReady flag, about 20s
        for a Common Meadow egg - and then IT DOES NOT OPEN BY ITSELF. Measured:
        eight eggs all reading HatchReady = true, 220 SECONDS past their HatchAt,
        none of them opened. The action is a second prompt on the same
        attachment, EggRoot.EggPromptAttachment.HatchPrompt ("Open", 14.9 studs,
        hold 0.5). Verified: eggs 8 -> 7, animals 1 -> 2, CashPerSecond 1 -> 16.
        Since Eggs.Placement.MaximumIncubatingEggs is 8 and an unopened egg
        holds its slot forever, this is the binding constraint on the entire
        farm - it outranks stealing, and a farm that only steals stalls at eight
        eggs with one animal.
      * ClaimAnimalIndexReward:FireServer(<animal name>) is NOT position gated
        and is the biggest lever in the game. Verified from the lobby:
        XP 39 -> 6 with a level crossing (+15) and Cash 881 -> 1085 (+200),
        matching Animals.List["Guienna Pig"].IndexReward exactly. Across the
        whole index that is 1,977,635 JumpXP and $161.5 TRILLION over 81
        animals - against a measured training rate of 2.5-2.8 XP/s at barbell
        level 1, where area 8 alone is ~115 hours of squatting. So a missing
        index entry outranks a merely richer duplicate, always.
      * leaderstats.Cash is a StringValue for display - the real number is its
        child Cash.V. Same for Level.V.
      * THE WHOLE MAP IS ON A TIMER. Areas.CaveCycle: every ~390s (min 300,
        +20s per extra player up to 5) the areas collapse, everyone is thrown
        back to their plot and all ~99 eggs are rerolled, with a 30s warning
        and a 10s evacuation. A carried egg has to be home before that.
      * GUARDS CANNOT BE SURVEYED FROM AFAR. workspace.ClientGuards is empty
        unless you are close (GuardDefaults.ClientSimulationDistanceStuds 200),
        so a guard census taken from the plot is a missing chunk, not "no
        guards". They aggro at 70 studs, fling at 95 power, ragdoll 3s and take
        the egg with a 35% chance per touch. The defence used here is simply
        not to dwell: the pin releases the frame the carry succeeds and the
        warp home is instant.

    Deliberately NOT automated, and why:

      * Everything with a ProductId. The player carries ~20 of them
        (Clone*ProductId x8, OfflineDoubleProductId, TeleportToBaseProductId,
        GrowAllEggsProductId, RobuxJumpXPProductId, the four CashTierProducts,
        ShopPackProducts) and Wheelspin is Robux-only AND Enabled = false.
      * autoBarbell, autoCode, autoOffline and autoEquipBest default OFF or are
        marked unverified in the panel - their remotes are read out of the
        client controllers but were never confirmed by a server value moving.
      * The Skeleton Fossils event (live until 2026-09-25, own Fragments
        currency, 500 Fragments -> a Fossiled Egg holding 8 index animals that
        are NOT gated behind Jump Power) is mapped but not automated yet.
      * Selling, the mutation machine, trails, coils and the pen upgrade are
        mapped in the recon doc and unimplemented here.
