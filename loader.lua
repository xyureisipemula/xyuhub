-- XYUREI X-FLOID hub loader - by XYUREI TEAM
--
-- One line in the executor, every game after that is automatic:
--
--   loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XYUREI TEAM012/XYUREI X-FLOID-rbx/main/loader.lua"))()
--
-- What it does, in order:
--
--   1. reads index.json from the repo (the registry of every game script)
--   2. matches the current place by PlaceId, and if that misses, by running the
--      entry's `detect` snippet - place ids change per map/lobby, capabilities
--      do not (Clean all the leaves teleports into a second place mid-run)
--   3. fetches lib/ui-template.lua ONCE, keeps the loaded module in _G.__SEL.ui
--      and also writefile()s it into the executor workspace, so a game script
--      that still does loadstring(readfile("ui-template.lua")) keeps working
--   4. runs the matching game script
--   5. re-arms itself with queue_on_teleport, so a lobby -> map teleport does
--      not drop the automation - but ONLY for the script that is already
--      running, and only in a place that BELONGS to that script. See AUTO-START
--      below.
--
-- Everything it downloads is cached under the executor workspace in XYUREI X-FLOID/, and
-- a failed HttpGet falls back to that cache instead of leaving you with nothing.
--
-- Nothing matched? A small panel lists every game in the registry and lets you
-- force one, and _G.__SEL.load("lootevo") does the same from the console.

-- EXECUTOR GATE -----------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Solara and Xeno are missing too many of the functions the scripts rely on
-- (hookmetamethod, getconnections, queue_on_teleport among them), and a script
-- half-running there generates bug reports we cannot fix. Detect and stop
-- before anything else runs. identifyexecutor can be absent or throw on some
-- executors, so both are guarded; no answer means no block.

-- AUTO-START --------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The queue below is what made this loader come back in EVERY game, not just
-- the one it was started in, and it is worth writing down exactly why, because
-- it does not look like it from the code:
--
--   * the loader queues THE LOADER, never a game script. So whatever place the
--     client lands in next, the hub runs there and looks for a match.
--   * it re-arms on every one of its own runs, so the chain never ends.
--   * and the new Roblox app keeps ONE PROCESS across game joins - measured on
--     this machine: a single client log with 15 different placeids in it. The
--     executor's queue lives in that process, so leaving a game and joining a
--     completely unrelated one is, to the queue, the same event as a teleport.
--
-- Handy when hopping from game to game all day, confusing for everybody else:
-- you run one line once and a panel keeps appearing over games you never asked
-- about. So it is a switch now, and it is OFF unless the file says otherwise -
-- which is what a fresh install and everybody who never touches it gets.
--
-- OFF does not mean the queue is gone. A script that is already running still
-- follows its own game across a place change (leaves lobby -> map, speedevolve
-- world 1 -> world 2); what stops is starting a DIFFERENT game's script by
-- itself.
--
-- That is decided TWICE, in two independent places, because the first one alone
-- kept failing in the wild:
--
--   1. THE QUEUED PAYLOAD GATES ITSELF, in the new place, before it fetches
--      anything. arm() bakes the entry's own PlaceId list and its `detect`
--      snippet into the queued string, so the payload's first act is to ask "am
--      I in a place that belongs to the script that armed me?". In any other
--      game it returns and NOTHING happens - the loader is not even downloaded,
--      so no marker has to survive the join for the refusal to work. This is the
--      part that had been missing: every fix before it depended on a marker
--      arriving intact, and when the marker did not arrive the loader read the
--      run as hand-typed and started whatever matched.
--   2. the alias the queue carries in _G.__SEL_TP, checked by mayStart() at the
--      bottom, which stays as the second line of defence.
--
-- NOTHING here needs the filesystem to work. The default is the hardcoded false
-- below and only an explicit 1/on/true moves it, so an executor with no file
-- API, a missing workspace folder or an isfile that throws all end up OFF -
-- which is the answer that cannot surprise anybody.

-- Re-executing does not restart the Lua VM, so a previous run's panels and loops
-- are still alive. Bump the generation and let the old ones notice.
local PREV = _G.__SEL
local GEN = ((PREV and PREV.gen) or 0) + 1

-- Set by the queued payload and by nothing else, so it is the one reliable
-- answer to "did a human start me, or did the queue?". A teleport builds a new
-- Lua VM, so it cannot be left over from the last place either.
--
-- It carries the ALIAS of the script that armed it, not just a boolean, and
-- that is on purpose: the alternative was a file in the workspace, which needs
-- makefolder/writefile/readfile to all exist and work. Plenty of mobile
-- executors have a partial or missing file API, and there the marker would be
-- unreadable - which would refuse the one case that has to keep working, a
-- script following its own game from a lobby into a map. The queued string is
-- something this loader writes itself, so it is available wherever the queue is.
-- ...and it is written in THREE places, because one of them is not reliable
-- everywhere. `_G` inside an executed script is not always the same table the
-- next execution sees - several executors sandbox each run and keep the shared
-- table behind getgenv() instead - and when the marker does not survive, the
-- loader reads "a human typed this" and starts a script in every game the client
-- joins. That is exactly what a user on Delta reported: "keeps loading in every
-- game". So the queued payload sets `_G.__SEL_TP`, `getgenv().__SEL_TP` and a
-- one-line file, and any of the three is enough.
--
-- The FILE is written by the queued payload itself, in the new place, and is
-- deleted here the moment it is read. That is what keeps it free of false
-- positives: a hand-typed loader line never writes it, so its presence means the
-- queue ran and nothing else. A stale copy left behind by a crash costs one
-- refusal and is gone afterwards.
--
-- Defined ABOVE the executor-global shims below on purpose, and reading the raw
-- globals rather than those locals: a local is invisible above its own
-- definition, so `isfile` in here is the executor's own function, guarded by the
-- pcall around it. Do not "tidy" this by moving the shims - moving the read
-- itself below them is the safe direction.
